We assume that the value of the competitive trait affects two different components of fitness, one measuring the benefit of winning contests and the other measuring the cost of developing the competitive trait. Unlike previous analyses, we include the population dynamical consequences of larger competitive trait values. Exaggeration of the competitive trait reduces the mean probability of survival during the non-competitive stage of the life cycle. The resulting lower population density reduces competition and, therefore, reduces the advantages of greater competitive ability. Models without population dynamics often predict dimorphism in the competitive trait when resource possession is decided by interactions with many other individuals. If the competition involves a contest with a single other individual, models without population dynamics often predict cycles of increase and collapse in the trait or a continual increase, possibly resulting in extinction. When population dynamics are included, both of these results become less likely and a single stable trait value becomes more likely. Population dynamics also make it possible to have dimorphism when individuals have a single pairwise contest and alternative stable trait values when an individual has many contests. Increases in the value of the resource being contested may increase or decrease the evolutionarily stable size of the trait. Competition between very differently sized species will often decrease size in the larger species (character convergence). \textcopyright{} 1994 Chapman \& Hall.},

Two models of adaptive change are explored: (1) change within a single reproducing prey population that has genetic variation for vulnerability to capture by the predator; and (2) direct competition between two independently reproducing prey populations that differ in their vulnerability. When an individual predator's consumption increases at a decreasing rate with prey availability, prey adaptation via either of these mechanisms may produce sustained cycles in both species' population densities and in the prey's mean trait value. Sufficiently rapid adaptive change (e.g., behavioral adaptation or evolution of traits with a large additive genetic variance), or sufficiently low predator birth and death rates will produce sustained cycles or chaos, even when the predator-prey dynamics with fixed prey capture rates would have been stable. Adaptive dynamics can also stabilize a system that would exhibit limit cycles if traits were fixed at their equilibrium values. When evolution fails to stabilize inherently unstable population interactions, selection decreases the prey's escape ability, which further destabilizes population dynamics. When the predator has a linear functional response, evolution of prey vulnerability always promotes stability. The relevance of these results to observed predator-prey cycles is discussed.},

Most of the analysis is based on a consumer-resource model introduced by Robert MacArthur. Contrary to many statements in the literature and in textbooks, measures of competition may decrease as similarity increases and may be greatest when similarity of the two species' sets of resource capture rates is very low. High competition with low similarity may occur whether competition is measured by a competition coefficient near equilibrium or is measured by the proportional increase in a species' population density when its competitor is removed. However, these two measures may differ considerably and may change in opposite directions with a given change in similarity. The general conditions required for such counterintuitive relationships between similarity and competition are that the consumer species have relatively low resource requirements for successful reproduction and that the resources be self-reproducing. These same conditions also frequently lead to exclusion of one or more resources via apparent competition, and this is always true of MacArthur's model. A variety of other models of competition are analyzed, and circumstances most likely to produce large competitive effects with little overlap are identified.},

This includes theory about the dynamics and stability of both populations and traits, as well as theory predicting how predatory and anti-predator traits should respond to environmental changes. Evolution can stabilize or destabilize interactions; stability is most likely when only the predator evolves, or when traits in one or both species are under strong stabilizing selection. Stability seems least likely when there is coevolution and a bi-directional axis of prey vulnerability. When population cycles exist, adaptation may either increase or decrease the amplitude of those cycles. An increase in the defensive ability of prey is less likely to produce evolutionary counter-measures in its partner than is a comparable increase in attack ability of the predator. Increased productivity may increase or decrease offensive and defensive adaptations. The apparent predominance of evolutionary responses of prey to predators over those of predators to prey is in general accord with equilibrium theory, but theory on sta-bility may be difficult to confirm or refute. Recent work on geographically structured populations promises to advance our understanding of the evolution of predator-prey interactions.},

  abstract = {This article investigates some simple models of the evolutionary interaction between two prey species that share a common resource and a common predator. Each prey species is characterized by a trait that determines both the rate of resource capture and vulnerability to a predator. In a simple model of a three-species food chain, such traits usually increase in response to an imposed reduction in resource density. When the per capita growth rates of each of two prey species depend linearly on resource density, such traits will change in opposite directions when the two prey come into sympatry. In addition, the ratio of the effect of the predator on prey fitness to the effect of the resource on prey fitness will diverge from the corresponding ratio in a second prey species when those species coexist in sympatry. These simple predictions need not hold under several alternative assumptions, which may be more common in biological systems. Parallel changes in sympatry may occur if the relationship between resource consumption and prey growth is non-linear, if the prey species have partial overlap in the set of resources used or in the set of predators that consume them, or if prey experience direct intraspecific competition. The responses to a second prey can also differ significantly from those predicted by the simplest model if separate traits affect vulnerability to predators and resource acquisition rate. It is important to determine whether examples of character displacement previously interpreted as responses to competition for resources might also reflect responses to altered predation risks in sympatry.},

  abstract = {Consumer-resource systems with linear arrays of substitutable resources form the conceptual basis of much of present-day competition theory. However, most analyses of the limiting similarity of competitors have only employed consumer-resource models as a justification for using the Lotka-Volterra competition equations to represent the interaction. Unfortunately, Lotka-Volterra models cannot reflect resource exclusion via apparent competition and are poor approximations of systems with nonlogistic resource growth. We use consumer-resource models to examine the impact of exclusion of biotic resources or depletion of abiotic resources on the ability of three consumer species to coexist along a one-dimensional resource axis. For a wide range of consumer-resource models, coexistence conditions can become more restrictive with increasing niche separation of the two outer species. This occurs when the outer species are highly efficient; in this case they cause extinction or severe depletion of intermediate resources when their own niches have an intermediate level of separation. In many cases coexistence of an intermediate consumer species is prohibited when niche separation of the two outer species is moderately large, but not when it is small. Coexistence may be most likely when the intermediate species is closer to one of the two outer species, contrary to previous theory. These results suggest that competition may lead to uneven spacing of utilization curves. The implications and range of applicability of the models are discussed. \textcopyright{} 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Ecological studies have demonstrated its importance in natural communities, but evolutionary models have predicted that selection either impedes coexistence or diminishes the storage effect if there is coexistence. Here, we develop a lottery model of competition in which two species experience a trade-off in competitive ability between two types of years. We use an adaptive evolution framework to determine conditions favoring the evolution of the storage effect. Storage evolves via divergence of relative performance in the two environments under a wide range of biologically realistic conditions. It evolves between two initially identical species (or lineages) when the trade-off in performance is strong enough. It evolves for species having different initial trade-offs for both weak and strong trade-offs. Our simple 2-species-2-environment scenario can be extended to multiple species and environmental conditions. Results indicate that the storage effect should evolve in a broad range of situations that involve a trade-off in competitive ability among years, and are consistent with empirical observations. The findings show that storage can evolve in a manner and under conditions similar to other types of resource partitioning. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Society for the Study of Evolution.},

We further show that even with a moderate number of sequencing errors, neutrality tests based on the frequency spectrum reject neutrality. This implies that analyses of data sets with such errors will systematically lead to wrong inferences of evolutionary scenarios. To avoid to these errors, we propose two new estimators of theta that ignore singletons as well as two new tests Y and Y* that can be used to test neutrality despite sequencing errors. All in all, we show that even though singletons are ignored, these new tests show some power to detect deviations from a standard neutral model.

  abstract = {The widespread correspondence between phenotypic variation and environmental conditions, the "fit" of organisms to their environment, reflects the adaptive value of plant functional traits. Several processes contribute to these patterns: plasticity, ecological sorting, and adaptive evolution. This article addresses the importance of ecological sorting processes (community assembly, migration, habitat tracking, etc.) as primary causes of functional trait distributions at the local and landscape level. In relatively saturated communities, plants will establish and regenerate in environments to which they are well adapted, so their distributions, and the distributions of associated functional traits, will reflect the distribution of optimal or near-optimal environmental conditions in space and time. The predicted evolutionary corollary of this process is that traits related to habitat occupancy, e.g., environmental tolerances, will be under stabilizing selection. This process contributes to the widely observed pattern of phylogenetic niche conservatism, i.e., ecological and phenotypic similarities of closely related species. Evidence for niche conservatism in plants is reviewed. Based on Jackson and Overpeck's concept of the realized environment, I propose three scenarios in which a species' distributional responses to environmental conditions will lead to a "mismatch" between its environmental tolerances and the environments it occupies, thus creating opportunities for adaptive evolution: (1) the colonization of "environmental islands" (habitats that are discontinuous in niche space) that require large adaptive shifts in tolerance of one or more environmental factors; (2) the persistence of "trailing-edge" populations in species tracking changing climate, if barriers to dispersal of competitors prevent competitive exclusion in the deteriorating conditions; and (3) responses to changes in the realized environment in multidimensional niche space, in which species are predicted to track environmental factors for which they exhibit narrow tolerances and exhibit adaptive evolutionary response along axes where they exhibit greater niche breadth. These three scenarios provide a conceptual framework that emphasizes the role of ecological sorting processes and stabilizing selection as the context for understanding opportunities for adaptive evolution in heterogeneous and changing environments.},

  abstract = {Ecologists now recognize that controversy over the relative importance of niches and neutrality cannot be resolved by analyzing species abundance patterns. Here, we use classical coexistence theory to reframe the debate in terms of stabilizing mechanisms (niches) and fitness equivalence (neutrality). The neutral model is a special case where stabilizing mechanisms are absent and species have equivalent fitness. Instead of asking whether niches or neutral processes structure communities, we advocate determining the degree to which observed diversity reflects strong stabilizing mechanisms overcoming large fitness differences or weak stabilization operating on species of similar fitness. To answer this question, we propose combining data on per capita growth rates with models to: (i) quantify the strength of stabilizing processes; (ii) quantify fitness inequality and compare it with stabilization; and (iii) manipulate frequency dependence in growth to test the consequences of stabilization and fitness equivalence for coexistence. \textcopyright{} 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

This vegetation heterogeneity can impact both the likelihood and strength of interactions between plants and insect herbivores. Because altering plant-herbivore interactions will likely impact the fitness of both partners, these ecological effects also have evolutionary consequences. We review several hypothesized and well-documented mechanisms whereby variation in the plant community alters the plant-herbivore interaction, discuss potential evolutionary outcomes of each of these ecological effects, and conclude by highlighting several avenues for future research. The underlying theme of this review is that the neighborhood of plants is an important determinant of insect attack, and this results in feedback effects on the plant community. Because plants exect selection on herbivore traits and, reciprocally, herbivores exert selection on plant-defense traits, variation in the plant community likely contributes to spatial and temporal variation in both plant and insect traits, which could influence macroevolutionary patterns.},

Comparative genotyping and phenotyping of nearly 12,000 O. biennis individuals revealed that in plots protected from insects, resistance to herbivores declined through time owing to changes in flowering time and lower defensive ellagitannins in fruits, whereas plant competitive ability increased. This independent real-time evolution of plant resistance and competitive ability in the field resulted from the relaxation of direct selective effects of insects on plant defense and through indirect effects due to reduced herbivory on plant competitors.},

To address these issues, we established eight replicate populations of native common evening primrose (Oenothera biennis). Each population was planted with 18 genotypes in identical frequency. By tracking genotype frequencies with microsatellite DNA markers over the subsequent three years (up to three generations, approximate to 5,000 genotyped plants), we show rapid and consistent evolution of two heritable plant life-history traits (shorter life span and later flowering time). This rapid evolution was only partially the result of differential seed production; genotypic variation in seed germination also contributed to the observed evolutionary response. Since evening primrose genotypes exhibited heritable variation for resistance to insect herbivores, which was related to flowering time, we predicted that evolutionary changes in genotype frequencies would feed back to influence populations of a seed predator moth that specializes on O. biennis. By the conclusion of the experiment, variation in the genotypic composition among our eight replicate field populations was highly predictive of moth abundance. These results demonstrate how rapid evolution in field populations of a native plant can influence ecological interactions.},

  abstract = {A charm of biology as a scientific discipline is the diversity of life. Although this diversity can make laws of biology challenging to discover, several repeated patterns and general principles govern evolutionary diversification. Convergent evolution, the independent evolution of similar phenotypes, has been at the heart of one approach to understand generality in the evolutionary process. Yet understanding when and why organismal traits and strategies repeatedly evolve has been a central challenge. These issues were the focus of the American Society of Naturalists Vice Presidential Symposium in 2016 and are the subject of this collection of articles. Although naturalists have long made inferences about convergent evolution and its importance, there has been confusion in the interpretation of the pattern of convergence. Does convergence primarily indicate adaptation or constraint? How often should convergence be expected? Are there general principles that would allow us to predict where and when and by what mechanisms convergent evolution should occur? What role does natural history play in advancing our understanding of general evolutionary principles? In this introductory article, I address these questions, review several generalizations about convergent evolution that have emerged over the past 15 years, and present a framework for advancing the study and interpretation of convergence. Perhaps the most important emerging conclusion is that the genetic mechanisms of convergent evolution are phylogenetically conserved; that is, more closely related species tend to share the same genetic basis of traits, even when independently evolved. Finally, I highlight how the articles in this special issue further develop concepts, methodologies, and case studies at the frontier of our understanding of the causes and consequences of convergent evolution.},

Here, we suggest a new approach based on bargaining theory to tackle the question. We present a mechanistic model for negotiation of benefits between a nitrogen-fixing nodule and a legume plant. To that end, we first derive growth rates for the nodule and plant from metabolic models of each as a function of material fluxes between them. We use these growth rates as pay-off functions in the negotiation process, which is analogous to collective bargaining between a firm and a workers' union. Our model predicts that negotiations lead to the Nash bargaining solution, maximizing the product of players' pay-offs. This work introduces elements of cooperative game theory into the field of mutualistic interactions. In the discussion of the paper, we argue for the benefits of such an approach in studying the question of biological cooperation.},

Most of the focus of studies of sequence variation is on single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and large structural variants. In principle, high-throughput sequencing studies should allow identification of indels just as SNVs. However, inference of indels from next-generation sequence data is challenging, and so far methods for identifying indels lag behind methods for calling SNVs in terms of sensitivity and specificity. We propose a Bayesian method to call indels from short-read sequence data in individuals and populations by realigning reads to candidate haplotypes that represent alternative sequence to the reference. The candidate haplotypes are formed by combining candidate indels and SNVs identified by the read mapper, while allowing for known sequence variants or candidates from other methods to be included. In our probabilistic realignment model we account for base-calling errors, mapping errors, and also, importantly, for increased sequencing error indel rates in long homopolymer runs. We show that our method is sensitive and achieves low false discovery rates on simulated and real data sets, although challenges remain. The algorithm is implemented in the program Dindel, which has been used in the 1000 Genomes Project call sets.},

Efforts to identify general mechanisms that limit invasion success, however, have been frustrated by disagreement between landscape-scale observations that generally find a positive relationship between native diversity and invasibility and smaller-scale experiments that consistently reveal competitive interactions that generate the opposite relationship. Here we experimentally elucidate the mechanism explaining the large-scale positive associations between invasion success and native intertidal diversity revealed in our landscape-scale surveys of New England shorelines. Experimental manipulations revealed this large-scale pattern is driven by a facilitation cascade where ecosystem-engineering species interact nonlinearly to enhance native diversity and invasion success by alleviating thermal stress and substrate instability. Our findings reveal that large-scale diversity-invasion relationships can be explained by small-scale positive interactions that commonly occur across multiple trophic levels and functional groups. We argue that facilitation has played an important but unrecognized role in the invasion of other well studied systems, and will be of increasing importance with anticipated climate change.},

The large-scale die-off of New England salt marshes was triggered by overfishing and resulted from decades of runaway crab grazing. In 2009, however, cordgrass began to recover, decreasing die-off {$\sim$}40\% by 2010. We used surveys and experiments to test whether plant\textendash substrate feedbacks underlie marsh resilience. Initially, grazer-generated die-off swept through the cordgrass, creating exposed, stressful peat banks that inhibited plant growth. This desertification cycle broke when banks eroded and peat transitioned into mud with fewer herbivores, less grazing, and lower physical stress. Cordgrass reestablished in these areas through a feedback where it engineered a recovery zone by further ameliorating physical stresses and facilitating additional revegetation. Our results reveal that feedbacks can play a critical role in rapid, reversible ecosystem shifts associated with human impacts, and that the interplay of...},

  abstract = {Floral nectar is commonly colonized by yeasts and bacteria, whose growth largely depends on their capacity to assimilate nutrient resources, withstand high osmotic pressures, and cope with unbalanced carbon-to-nitrogen ratios. Although the basis of the ecological success of these microbes in the harsh environment of nectar is still poorly understood, it is reasonable to assume that they are efficient nitrogen scavengers that can consume a wide range of nitrogen sources in nectar. Furthermore, it can be hypothesized that phylogenetically closely related strains have more similar phenotypic characteristics than distant relatives. We tested these hypotheses by investigating the growth performance on different nitrogen-rich substrates of a collection of 82 acinetobacters isolated from nectar and honeybees, representing members of five species (Acinetobacter nectaris, A. boissieri, A. apis, and the recently described taxa A. bareti and A. pollinis). We also analyzed possible links between growth performance and phylogenetic affiliation of the isolates, while taking into account their geographical origin. Results demonstrated that the studied isolates could utilize a wide variety of nitrogen sources, including common metabolic by-products of yeasts (e.g., ammonium and urea), and that phylogenetic relatedness was associated with the variation in nitrogen assimilation among the studied acinetobacters. Finally, nutrient source and the origin (sample type and country) of isolates also predicted the ability of the acinetobacters to assimilate nitrogen-rich compounds. Overall, these results demonstrate inter-clade variation in the potential of the acinetobacters as nitrogen scavengers and suggest that nutritional dependences might influence interactions between bacteria and yeasts in floral nectar.},

Transport from land to water is common and well studied; here, we document a less recognized process, substantial flows from water to land. On hyperarid, naturally nutrient poor islands in the Gulf of California, nutrient input via seabird guano directly increases N and P concentrations up to 6-fold in soils; these nutrients enrich plants. Nutrients in a long-lived cactus, a short-lived shrub, and annuals were 1.6- to 2.4-fold greater on bird versus nonbird islands. Because plant quality affects consumer growth and reproduction, we suggest that nutrient enrichment via guano ramifies to affect the entire food web on these islands.},

  abstract = {Microbes live in complex communities that are of major importance for environmental ecology, public health, and animal physiology and pathology. Short-read metagenomic shotgun sequencing is currently the state-of-the-art technique for exploring these communities. With the aid of metagenomics, our understanding of the microbiome is moving from composition toward functionality, even down to the genetic variant level. While the exploration of single-nucleotide variation in a genome is a standard procedure in genomics, and many sophisticated tools exist to perform this task, identification of genetic variation in metagenomes remains challenging. Major factors that hamper the widespread application of variant-calling analysis include low-depth sequencing of individual genomes (which is especially significant for the microorganisms present in low abundance), the existence of large genomic variation even within the same species, the absence of comprehensive reference genomes, and the noise introduced by next-generation sequencing errors. Some bioinformatics tools, such as metaSNV or InStrain, have been created to identify genetic variants in metagenomes, but the performance of these tools has not been systematically assessed or compared with the variant callers commonly used on single or pooled genomes. In this study, we benchmark seven bioinformatic tools for genetic variant calling in metagenomics data and assess their performance. To do so, we simulated metagenomic reads to mimic human microbial composition, sequencing errors, and genetic variability. We also simulated different conditions, including low and high depth of coverage and unique or multiple strains per species. Our analysis of the simulated data shows that probabilistic method-based tools such as HaplotypeCaller and Mutect2 from the GATK toolset show the best performance. By applying these tools to longitudinal gut microbiome data from the Human Microbiome Project, we show that the genetic similarity between longitudinal samples from the same individuals is significantly greater than the similarity between samples from different individuals. Our benchmark shows that probabilistic tools can be used to call metagenomes, and we recommend the use of GATK's tools as reliable variant callers for metagenomic samples.},

However, we know little about the assembly and disassembly processes under which a community can reach such a maximum number, or whether this number is in fact attainable in practice. This limitation is partly due to the challenge of performing experimental work and partly due to the lack of a formalism under which one can systematically study such processes. Here, we introduce a formalism based on algebraic topology and homology theory to study the space of species coexistence formed by a given pool of species. We show that this space is characterized by ubiquitous discontinuities that we call coexistence holes (that is, empty spaces surrounded by filled space). Using theoretical and experimental systems, we provide direct evidence showing that these coexistence holes do not occur arbitrarily\textemdash their diversity is constrained by the internal structure of species interactions and their frequency can be explained by the external factors acting on these systems. Our work suggests that the assembly and disassembly of ecological systems is a discontinuous process that tends to obey regularities.},

This new ecological genetics has developed a series of tenets that emphasize the importance of considering genetic and ecological factors in concert: 1) Explaining the abundance and distribution of organisms is basically the genetic problem of explaining limits to natural selection. 2) An understanding of community structure will come from consideration of how forces maintaining species diversity and genetic diversity interact. 3) Adaptation is operationally definable in terms of mortality and fecundity of individuals in populations. 4) Adaptation to new environments results in different genotypes with different life histories. 5) The distinction between "ecological time" and "evolutionary time" is artificial and misleading.},

However, until recently it has been difficult to identify the precise genetic changes underlying adaptation at a genome-wide scale. New DNA sequencing technologies now allow the genome of parental and evolved strains of microorganisms to be rapidly determined. We sequenced {$>$}93.5\% of the genome of a laboratory-evolved strain of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its ancestor at {$>$}28\texttimes{} depth. Both single nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number amplifications were found, with specific gains over array-based methodologies previously used to analyze these genomes. Applying a segmentation algorithm to quantify structural changes, we determined the approximate genomic boundaries of a 5\texttimes{} gene amplification. These boundaries guided the recovery of breakpoint sequences, which provide insights into the nature of a complex genomic rearrangement. This study suggests that whole-genome sequencing can provide a rapid approach to uncover the genetic basis of evolutionary adaptations, with further applications in the study of laboratory selections and mutagenesis screens. In addition, we show how single-end, short read sequencing data can provide detailed information about structural rearrangements, and generate predictions about the genomic features and processes that underlie genome plasticity.},

  abstract = {Many social animals live in stable groups. In contrast, African savannah elephants (Loxodonta africana) live in unusually fluid, fission-fusion societies. That is, 'core' social groups are composed of predictable sets of individuals; however, over the course of hours or days, these groups may temporarily divide and reunite, or they may fuse with other social groups to form much larger social units. Here, we test the hypothesis that genetic relatedness predicts patterns of group fission and fusion among wild, female African elephants. Our study of a single Kenyan population spans 236 individuals in 45 core social groups, genotyped at 11 microsatellite and one mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) locus. We found that genetic relatedness predicted group fission; adult females remained with their first order maternal relatives when core groups fissioned temporarily. Relatedness also predicted temporary fusion between social groups; core groups were more likely to fuse with each other when the oldest females in each group were genetic relatives.

To better understand the macroevolutionary consequences of competition, as well as the signal left on phylogenetic data, we developed a model linking trait evolution and species diversification in an ecological context. We find four main results: first, competition spurs trait diversity but not necessarily species richness; second, competition produces slowdowns in species diversification even in the absence of explicit ecological limits, but not in phenotypic diversification even in the presence of such limits; third, early burst patterns do not provide a reliable way of testing for adaptive radiations; and fourth, looking for phylogenetic signal in trait data and support for phenotypic models incorporating competition is a better alternative. Our results clarify the macroevolutionary consequences of competition and could help design more powerful tests of adaptive radiations in nature.},

We show that previous attempts to prove that n species cannot coexist on fewer that n resources (the "competitive exclusion principle") all make use of the very restrictive assumption that the specific growth rates of all competing species are linear functions of resource densities. When this restriction is relaxed, it becomes possible to find situations in which n species can coexist on fewer than n resources. On the basis of this and other observations we conclude that the competitive exclusion principle should be considered to apply only to coexistence at fixed densities. \textcopyright{} 1976.},

  abstract = {Avian postnatal growth has received considerable attention and its ecological implications have been deeply analyzed. In this current paper, I describe the patterns of culmen and tarsus growth, as well as of weight gain patterns in eight species of herons and egrets (Aves: Ardeidae) found in the Birama Swamp in Eastern Cuba. Between 1998 and 2006,714 nestlings of the following species were measured every two days: Butorides virescens, Bubulcus ibis, Egretta thula, E. tricolor, E. caerulea, E. rufescens, Ardea alba and Nycticorax nycticorax. Logistic and Gompertz equations were adjusted to data using non-lineal regression models with adult values as the asymptote. For each species, the following were determined and recorded: growth rate, age at inflexion, instantaneous growth rates at each age interval, and time taken to reach 90\% of adult size. Reported hatchling sizes were similar in other localities, with a variation coefficient ranging between 10-19\%. At hatch, each species exhibited differing sizes relative to adult values. In all cases, Gompertz equations were best fitted to explain more variance and lesser residuals. Rates of weight change and tarsus growth were alometrically related to the log of adult weight. Two main growth processes were identified: a physical extension in dimensions of each measurement reflecting inter-specific morphometric differences, and a lineal increase of the growth period from Green Heron to Great Egret. The Black-crowned Night Heron, Cattle Egret and Reddish Egret exhibited some unique measurement characteristics in comparison to the remaining members of the family. All results support the hypothesis that hypermorphosis, as the main evolutionary process in the microevolution of Ardeidae, is caused by a delayed final moment of growth.},

  abstract = {Quantitative genetics has primarily focused on describing genetic effects on trait means and largely ignored the effect of alternative alleles on trait variability, potentially missing an important axis of genetic variation contributing to phenotypic differences among individuals. To study the genetic effects on individual-to-individual phenotypic variability (or intragenotypic variability), we used Drosophila inbred lines and measured the spontaneous locomotor behavior of flies walking individually in Y-shaped mazes, focusing on variability in locomotor handedness, an assay optimized to measure variability. We discovered that some lines had consistently high levels of intragenotypic variability among individuals, whereas lines with low variability behaved as although they tossed a coin at each left/right turn decision. We demonstrate that the degree of variability is itself heritable. Using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for the degree of intragenotypic variability as the phenotype across lines, we identified several genes expressed in the brain that affect variability in handedness without affecting the mean. One of these genes, Ten-a, implicates a neuropil in the central complex of the fly brain as influencing the magnitude of behavioral variability, a brain region involved in sensory integration and locomotor coordination. We validated these results using genetic deficiencies, null alleles, and inducible RNAi transgenes. Our study reveals the constellation of phenotypes that can arise from a single genotype and shows that different genetic backgrounds differ dramatically in their propensity for phenotypic variabililty. Because traditional mean-focused GWASs ignore the contribution of variability to overall phenotypic variation, current methods may miss important links between genotype and phenotype.},

  abstract = {Statistical models, such as linear or logistic regression or survival analysis, are frequently used as a means to answer scientific questions in psychosomatic research. Many who use these techniques, however, apparently fail to appreciate fully the problem of overfitting, ie, capitalizing on the idiosyncrasies of the sample at hand. Overfitted models will fail to replicate in future samples, thus creating considerable uncertainty about the scientific merit of the finding. The present article is a nontechnical discussion of the concept of overfitting and is intended to be accessible to readers with varying levels of statistical expertise. The notion of overfitting is presented in terms of asking too much from the available data. Given a certain number of observations in a data set, there is an upper limit to the complexity of the model that can be derived with any acceptable degree of uncertainty. Complexity arises as a function of the number of degrees of freedom expended (the number of predictors including complex terms such as interactions and nonlinear terms) against the same data set during any stage of the data analysis. Theoretical and empirical evidence--with a special focus on the results of computer simulation studies--is presented to demonstrate the practical consequences of overfitting with respect to scientific inference. Three common practices--automated variable selection, pretesting of candidate predictors, and dichotomization of continuous variables--are shown to pose a considerable risk for spurious findings in models. The dilemma between overfitting and exploring candidate confounders is also discussed. Alternative means of guarding against overfitting are discussed, including variable aggregation and the fixing of coefficients a priori. Techniques that account and correct for complexity, including shrinkage and penalization, also are introduced.},

  abstract = {Tropical forests are important reservoirs of biodiversity, but the processes that maintain this diversity remain poorly understood. The Janzen-Connell hypothesis suggests that specialized natural enemies such as insect herbivores and fungal pathogens maintain high diversity by elevating mortality when plant species occur at high density (negative density dependence; NDD). NDD has been detected widely in tropical forests, but the prediction that NDD caused by insects and pathogens has a community-wide role in maintaining tropical plant diversity remains untested. We show experimentally that changes in plant diversity and species composition are caused by fungal pathogens and insect herbivores. Effective plant species richness increased across the seed-to-seedling transition, corresponding to large changes in species composition. Treating seeds and young seedlings with fungicides significantly reduced the diversity of the seedling assemblage, consistent with the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. Although suppressing insect herbivores using insecticides did not alter species diversity, it greatly increased seedling recruitment and caused a marked shift in seedling species composition. Overall, seedling recruitment was significantly reduced at high conspecific seed densities and this NDD was greatest for the species that were most abundant as seeds. Suppressing fungi reduced the negative effects of density on recruitment, confirming that the diversity-enhancing effect of fungi is mediated by NDD. Our study provides an overall test of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis and demonstrates the crucial role that insects and pathogens have both in structuring tropical plant communities and in maintaining their remarkable diversity.},

  abstract = {The role of positive interactions in structuring plant and animal communities is increasingly recognized, but the generality of current theoretical models has remained practically unexplored in animal communities. The stress gradient hypothesis predicts a linear increase in the intensity of facilitation as environmental conditions become increasingly stressful, whereas other theoretical models predict a maximum at intermediate environmental stress. We tested how competition and facilitation between herbivores change over a manipulated gradient of nutrient availability. We studied the effect of grazing by pond snails (Lymnaea stagnalis L.) as bulk grazers on aquatic caterpillars (Acentria ephemerella Denis and Schifferm\"uller) as small specialist grazers along an experimental gradient of environmental nutrient concentration. Higher nutrient levels increased overall total plant biomass but induced a shift toward dominance of filamentous algae at the expense of macrophytes. Facilitation of caterpillars by snail presence peaked at intermediate nutrient levels. Both caterpillar biomass and caterpillar grazing on macrophytes were highest at intermediate nutrient levels. Snails facilitated caterpillars possibly by removing filamentous algae and increasing access to the macrophyte resource, whereas they did not affect macrophyte biomass or C: nutrient ratios, a measure of food quality. We conclude that competition and facilitation in herbivore communities change along nutrient availability gradients that affect plant biomass and community composition. Understanding how interspecific interactions may change in strength and direction along environmental gradients is important to predict how the diversity and structure of communities may respond to the introduction or removal of herbivore species in ecosystems.},

Here we explore the consequences of intraspecific trait variation for coexistence in two- and multispecies competitive communities. For two species, the likelihood of coexistence is in general reduced by intraspecific variation, except when the species have almost equal trait means but different trait variances, such that one is a generalist and the other a specialist consumer. In multispecies communities, the only strong effect of non-heritable intraspecific variation is to reduce expected species richness. However, when intraspecific variation is heritable, allowing for the possibility of trait evolution, communities are much more resilient against environmental disturbance and exhibit far more predictable trait patterns. Our results are robust to varying model parameters and relaxing model assumptions.},

Our goal is for both theoretical and empirical ecologists to be able to use the theory to interpret their findings, and to get a precise sense of the limits of its applicability. To this end, we introduce an explicit handling of limiting factors, and a new way of defining the scaling factors that partition invasion growth rates into the different mechanisms contributing to coexistence. We explain terminology such as relative nonlinearity, storage effect, and growth-density covariance, both in a formal setting and through their biological interpretation. We review the theory's applications and contributions to our current understanding of species coexistence. While the theory is very general, it is not well suited to all problems, so we carefully point out its limitations. Finally, we critique the paradigm of decomposing invasion growth rates into stabilizing and equalizing components: we argue that these concepts are useful when used judiciously, but have often been employed in an overly simplified way to justify false claims.},

Evolutionary theorists have raised the possibility that some types of vaccine could also create conditions favoring the evolution of more virulent pathogens. Such evolution would put unvaccinated people at greater risk of severe disease. Here we test the impact of vaccination with a single highly purified antigen on the malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi evolving in laboratory mice. The antigen we used, AMA-1, is a component of several candidate malaria vaccines currently in various stages of trials in humans. We first found that a more virulent clone was less readily controlled by AMA-1-induced immunity than its less virulent progenitor. Replicated parasites were then serially passaged through control or AMA-1 vaccinated mice and evaluated after 10 and 21 rounds of selection. We found no evidence of evolution at the ama-1 locus. Instead, virulence evolved; AMA-1-selected parasites induced greater anemia in na\"ive mice than both control and ancestral parasites. Our data suggest that recombinant blood stage malaria vaccines can drive the evolution of more virulent malaria parasites.},

  abstract = {The processes that drive the evolution of snake venom variability, particularly the role of diet, have been a topic of intense recent research interest. Here, we test whether extensive variation in venom composition in the medically important viper genus Echis is associated with shifts in diet. Examination of stomach and hindgut contents revealed extreme variation between the major clades of Echis in the proportion of arthropod prey consumed. The toxicity (median lethal dose, LD(50)) of representative Echis venoms to a natural scorpion prey species was found to be strongly associated with the degree of arthropod feeding. Mapping the results onto a novel Echis phylogeny generated from nuclear and mitochondrial sequence data revealed two independent instances of coevolution of venom toxicity and diet. Unlike venom LD(50), the speed with which venoms incapacitated and killed scorpions was not associated with the degree of arthropod feeding. The prey-specific venom toxicity of arthropod-feeding Echis may thus be adaptive primarily by reducing venom expenditure. Overall, our results provide strong evidence that variation in snake venom composition results from adaptive evolution driven by natural selection for different diets, and underscores the need for a multi-faceted, integrative approach to the study of the causes of venom evolution.},

  abstract = {Food habits of American alligators from Shark River Slough, Everglades National Park, Dade County, Florida were investigated during October and March of two consecutive years, 1994-1996. Larger alligators fed predominately on snakes, aquatic salamanders, and snails. Fish were of minor importance in the diet of larger alligators but were the only vertebrates utilized by smaller alligators. Birds and mammals were not consumed in great numbers by any size class. Apple snails were recovered in large numbers from most size classes. Snails were the most important prey for subadults and juveniles, whereas the smallest alligators preyed almost exclusively on insects.Little seasonal variation existed in prey use, although predation on salamanders was significantly higher in October. There were no sexual differences in the use of any prey. Small alligators fed predominately on invertebrates, and with increasing size, they incorporated vertebrates into the diet.I quantified gastric residence times for seven prey species. Portions of the turtle, bird, and mammal remained in the stomach for at least 10 days after ingestion. In contrast, frogs exited the stomach five times faster than the snake or salamander, and three times faster than the insect. To minimize the biasing effects of differential gastric residence times, a series of standards reflecting recent ingestion were created. These criteria were utilized to reanalyze the stomach content data.Reanalysis revealed that many prey taxa were substantially over-represented by frequency of occurrence and mass. Significant statistical reductions in mass existed for every prey class except crustaceans and fishes when applying the 48 hr residency criterion. These adjustments resulted in a more accurate representation of prey importance in the diet of alligators.I calculated relative condition factors on juvenile alligators to explore the idea that southern Everglades alligators have higher relative body conditions during periods of low water. However, mean body condition was significantly higher during the wet season collection periods, refuting the hypothesis.},

Studies of adaptive evolution of temperature tolerance have typically involved correlative analyses of natural populations or artificial selection experiments in the laboratory. Field experiments are required to provide estimates of the timing and strength of natural selection, enhance understanding of the genetics of adaptation and yield insights into the mechanisms driving evolutionary change. Here, we report the experimental evolution of cold tolerance in natural populations of threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We show that freshwater sticklebacks are able to tolerate lower minimum temperatures than marine sticklebacks and that this difference is heritable. We transplanted marine sticklebacks to freshwater ponds and measured the rate of evolution after three generations in this environment. Cold tolerance evolved at a rate of 0.63 haldanes to a value 2.5 degrees C lower than that of the ancestral population, matching values found in wild freshwater populations. Our results suggest that cold tolerance is under strong selection and that marine sticklebacks carry sufficient genetic variation to adapt to changes in temperature over remarkably short time scales.},

  abstract = {All humans become infected with multiple herpesviruses during childhood. After clearance of acute infection, herpesviruses enter a dormant state known as latency. Latency persists for the life of the host and is presumed to be parasitic, as it leaves the individual at risk for subsequent viral reactivation and disease. Here we show that herpesvirus latency also confers a surprising benefit to the host. Mice latently infected with either murine gammaherpesvirus 68 or murine cytomegalovirus, which are genetically highly similar to the human pathogens Epstein-Barr virus and human cytomegalovirus, respectively, are resistant to infection with the bacterial pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia pestis. Latency-induced protection is not antigen specific but involves prolonged production of the antiviral cytokine interferon-gamma and systemic activation of macrophages. Latency thereby upregulates the basal activation state of innate immunity against subsequent infections. We speculate that herpesvirus latency may also sculpt the immune response to self and environmental antigens through establishment of a polarized cytokine environment. Thus, whereas the immune evasion capabilities and lifelong persistence of herpesviruses are commonly viewed as solely pathogenic, our data suggest that latency is a symbiotic relationship with immune benefits for the host.},

  abstract = {Theory suggests evolutionary change can significantly influence and act in tandem with ecological forces via ecological-evolutionary feedbacks. This theory assumes that significant evolutionary change occurs over ecologically relevant timescales and that phenotypes have differential effects on the environment. Here we test the hypothesis that local adaptation causes ecosystem structure and function to diverge. We demonstrate that populations of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata), characterized by differences in phenotypic and population-level traits, differ in their impact on ecosystem properties. We report results from a replicated, common garden mesocosm experiment and show that differences between guppy phenotypes result in the divergence of ecosystem structure (algal, invertebrate, and detrital standing stocks) and function (gross primary productivity, leaf decomposition rates, and nutrient flux). These phenotypic effects are further modified by effects of guppy density. We evaluated the generality of these effects by replicating the experiment using guppies derived from two independent origins of the phenotype. Finally, we tested the ability of multiple guppy traits to explain observed differences in the mesocosms. Our findings demonstrate that evolution can significantly affect both ecosystem structure and function. The ecosystem differences reported here are consistent with patterns observed across natural streams and argue that guppies play a significant role in shaping these ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Over the past 15 years, the number of papers focused on `eco-evo dynamics' has increased exponentially (Figure 1). This pattern suggests the rapid growth of a new, integrative discipline. We argue this overstates the case. First, the terms `eco-evo dynamics' and `eco-evo interactions' are used too imprecisely. As a result, many studies that claim to describe eco-evo dynamics are actually describing basic ecological or evolutionary processes. Second, these terms are often used as if the study of how ecological and evolutionary processes are intertwined is novel when, in fact, it is not. The result is confusion over what the term `eco-evolution' and its derivatives describe. We advocate a more precise definition of eco-evolution that is more useful in efforts to understand and characterise the diversity of ecological and evolutionary processes and that focuses attention on the subset of those processes that occur only when ecological and evolutionary timescales are comparable.},

However, little is known about how the qualitative properties of eco-evolutionary dynamics (e.g., cycling, equilibrium, etc.) are affected by the amount of heritable variation present. Here, we show that a change in the range of variation in a heritable prey defense trait determines what dynamics are observed in an experimental predator-prey system. We combine modelling and laboratory experiments to show that initial defense trait variation determines whether populations exhibit eco-evolutionary cycles in which heritable variation is maintained, or converge to an equilibrium at which the prey population becomes monomorphic. Our results show how small changes in the amount of adaptive genetic variance initially present can radically alter eco-evolutionary dynamics, and can ultimately determine whether heritable variation is maintained or lost.},

In predator-prey (rotifer-alga) microcosms, cyclical changes in predator abundance generated fluctuating selection for a heritable prey defence trait, cell clumping. Predator population growth was affected more by prey evolution than by changes in prey abundance, and changes in predator abundance drove further prey evolution, completing the feedback loop. Within a predator-prey cycle, genes up-regulated as clumping declined were down-regulated as clumping increased, and vice-versa. Genes changing most in expression tended to be associated with defence or its cost. Expression patterns of individual genes differed greatly between consecutive cycles (often reversing direction), suggesting that a particular phenotype may be produced by several (perhaps many) different gene transcription pathways.},

However, ben- efits to birds have been documented in only four such associations, and no previous research has rigorously investigated costs or benefits to associated hymenopterans. We followed the nesting cycles of an estrildid finch, the Red-cheeked Cordonbleu (Uraeginthus bengalus), and a common nesting associate, the wasp Ropalidia cincta, during 2002 and 2003 in northern Ghana to compare reproductive success of birds and wasps nesting in association with that of birds and wasps nesting separately. Red-cheeked Cordonbleus and wasps nested together in the same tree 3.7\texttimes{} as o(en as expected if nesting decisions were made independently, with 74\% of bird nests and 74\% of wasp colonies occurring in associations. Bird nesting was initiated {$\sim$}33 days a(er founding of an associated wasp colony; bird nests and wasp colonies were, on average, 42 cm apart. In both years, Red-cheeked Cordonbleus in nesting associations with wasps were twice as likely to fledge young as birds nesting in trees without wasps. Reduced predation was apparently a major reason for increased fledging suc- cess: we documented four cases of nest predation on 122 Red-cheeked Cordonbleu nests associated with wasps, and 11 cases on 90 nests not associated with wasps. Association with birds did not affect the success of wasp colonies. Although our observational study cannot rule out the possibility that both species coincidentally shared a preference for a habitat feature in limited supply, suitable nest sites did not appear to be limiting (74\% of potential nest trees had neither bird nor wasp nests). Reproductive success of Red-cheeked Cordonbleu populations in this region may be limited by the number of available wasp colonies. By designing our study to address four working hypotheses (commensalism, mutualism, parasitism, coincidence of habitat preference), we have provided strong evidence that this relationship is com- mensal.},

We examined the distribution of the yeast, Metschnikowia reukaufii, and other fungal species found in the floral nectar of the sticky monkey flower, Mimulus aurantiacus, a hummingbird-pollinated shrub, at a California site. We found that the frequency of nectar-inhabiting microfungi on a given host plant was not significantly correlated with light availability, nectar volume, or the percent cover of M. aurantiacus around the plant, but was significantly correlated with the location of the host plant and loosely correlated with the density of flowers on the plant. These results suggest that dispersal limitation caused by spatially nonrandom foraging by pollinators may be a primary factor driving the observed distribution pattern. \textcopyright{} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

This process is called evolutionary rescue and has been studied under different names in medicine, agriculture, and conservation biology. It is a component of the emerging field of eco-evolutionary dynamics, which investigates how the ecological attributes of species may evolve rapidly under strong selection. Its distinguishing feature is to combine the evolutionary concept of relative fitness with the ecological concept of absolute fitness in a synthetic theory of persistent adaptation. The likelihood of rescue will depend both on attributes of the population, particularly abundance and variation, and on properties of the environment, particularly the rate and severity of deterioration. Medical interventions (e.g., the administration of antibiotics), agricultural practices (e.g., the application of pesticides), and population ecology (e.g., the effects of species introductions) provide numerous examples of evolutionary rescue. The general theory of rescue has been tested in laboratory experiments with microbes, in which experimental evolution shows how different treatments affect the frequency of rescue. Overall, these experiments have supported the predictions of general theory: In particular, abundance, variation, and dispersal have pronounced and repeatable effects on the rescue of populations and communities. Extending these laboratory results to the field is a major task for future research.},

Here we report that, although rats have evolved anti-predator avoidance of areas with signs of cat presence, T. gondii's manipulation appears to alter the rat's perception of cat predation risk, ill some cases turning their innate aversion into an imprudent attraction. The selectivity of such behavioural changes suggests that this ubiquitous parasite subtly alters the brain of its intermediate host to enhance predation rate whilst leaving other behavioural categories and general health intact. This is in contrast to the gross impediments frequently characteristic of many other host-parasite systems. We discuss our results in terms of their potential implications both for the epidemiology of toxoplasmosis and the neurological basis of anxiety and cognitive processes in humans and other mammals.},

According to the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis, testosterone (T) is responsible for this result as it drives the development and maintenance of sexual characters and causes immunosuppression. But glucocorticoids also have strong influences on immune function and may also be elevated in reproductively active males. Here, we compared immune activity using the phytohemagglutinin (PHA) skin test in three discrete groups of male marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus): territorials, satellites, and bachelors. Males of these three reproductive phenotypes had indistinguishable T concentrations during the height of the breeding season, but their corticosterone (cort) concentrations, body condition and hematocrit were significantly different. Territorial males, the animals with the most elaborate sexual ornaments and behaviors, had lower immune responses and body condition but higher cort concentrations and hematocrit than satellites or bachelors. To test directly cort's immunosuppressive role, we elevated cort by either restraining animals or additionally injecting cort and compared their PHA swelling response with the response of free-roaming animals. Such experimental elevation of cort significantly decreased immune activity in both restrained and cort-injected animals. Our data show that cort can induce immunosuppression, but they do not support the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis in its narrow sense because T concentrations were not related to immunosuppression.},

  abstract = {Relationships among families of the lower Diptera (formerly suborder `Nematocera') have been exceptionally difficult to resolve. Multiple hypotheses based on morphology have been proposed to identify the earliest lineages of flies and place the phylogenetic origin of the higher flies (Brachycera), but convincing support is limited. Here we resolve relationships among the major groups of lower Diptera using sequence data from four nuclear markers, including both ribosomal (28S rDNA) and protein-coding (CAD, TPI and PGD) genes. Our results support both novel and traditional arrangements. Most unexpectedly, the small, highly-specialized family Deuterophlebiidae appears to be sister to all remaining Diptera. Other results include the resolution of the traditional infra-orders Culicomorpha (including a novel superfamily Simulioidea {$\frac{1}{4}$} Thaumaleidae \th{} Simuliidae), Tipulomorpha (Tipulidae sensu lato \th{} Trichoceridae) and Bibionomorpha sensu lato. We find support for a limited Psychodomorpha (Blephariceridae, Tanyderidae and Psychodidae) and Ptychopteromorpha (Ptychopteridae), whereas the placement of several enigmatic families (Nymphomyiidae, Axymyiidae and Perissommatidae) remains ambiguous. According to genetic data, the infra-order Bibionomorpha is sister to the Brachycera. Much of the phylogenetic signal for major lineages was found in the 28S rDNA gene, whereas protein-coding genes performed variably at different levels. In addition to elucidating relationships, we also estimate the age of major lower dipteran clades, based on molecular divergence time estimates using relaxed-clock Bayesian methods and fossil calibration points.},

By using experimental coevolution of a host bacterium and its viral parasites, we revealed that diverse parasite communities accelerated host evolution and altered coevolutionary dynamics to enhance host resistance and decrease parasite infectivity. Increases in parasite diversity drove shifts in the mode of selection from fluctuating (Red Queen) dynamics to predominately directional (arms race) dynamics. Arms race dynamics were characterized by selective sweeps of generalist resistance mutations in the genes for the host bacterium's cell surface lipopolysaccharide (a bacteriophage receptor), which caused faster molecular evolution within host populations and greater genetic divergence among populations. These results indicate that exposure to multiple parasites influences the rate and type of host-parasite coevolution.},

Mutualistic interactions generate positive feedbacks on abundance and therefore are not thought to contribute to the maintenance of diversity. Here, I report evidence of negative feedback on plant growth through changes in the composition of their mutualistic fungal symbionts, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Negative feedback results from asymmetries in the delivery of benefit between plant and AM fungal species in which the AM fungus that grows best with the plant Plantago lanceolata is a poor growth promoter for Plantago. Growth of Plantago is, instead, best promoted by the AM fungal species that accumulate with a second plant species, Panicum sphaerocarpon. The resulting community dynamic leads to a decline in mutualistic benefit received by Plantago, and can contribute to the coexistence of these two competing plant species.},

Yet, these population genomic estimates are available for only a limited number of model organisms. Here we focus on the population genomics of the pea aphid ( Acyrthosiphon pisum ). The pea aphid is an emerging model system that exhibits a range of intriguing biological traits not present in classic model systems. We performed low-coverage genome resequencing of 21 clonal pea aphid lines collected from alfalfa host plants in North America to characterize genome-wide patterns of diversity and selection. We observed an excess of low-frequency polymorphisms throughout coding and noncoding DNA, which we suggest is the result of a founding event and subsequent population expansion in North America. Most gene regions showed lower levels of Tajima's D than synonymous sites, suggesting that the majority of the genome is not evolving neutrally but rather exhibits significant constraint. Furthermore, we used the pea aphid's unique manner of X-chromosome inheritance to assign genomic scaffolds to either autosomes or the X chromosome. Comparing autosomal vs. X-linked sequence variation, we discovered that autosomal genes show an excess of low frequency variants indicating that purifying selection acts more efficiently on the X chromosome. Overall, our results provide a critical first step in characterizing the genetic diversity and evolutionary pressures on an aphid genome.},

The following year, when the area around Pumpkinseed Island received slightly above average rainfall, but the area around Drum Island received slightly below average rainfall, the number of pairs breeding at Pumpkinseed increased to 5132, while the number of pairs at Drum decreased to 388. On Drum Island, the percent of ibis eggs that resulted in fledgings declined from 39\% in 1984 to 3\% in 1985. Other more piscivorous wading birds breeding on Drum Island did not exhibit similar declines in numbers or in reproductive success in 1985. On Pumpkinseed Island a substantially lower proportion of ibises flew inland to feed on crayfishes in freshwater wetlands in 1985 and 1986 than in 1984. At both sites, nestling diets contained a lower proportion of crayfish in 1985 than in 1984, and many more nestlings starved or were abandoned by their parents in 1985, and to a lesser extent in 1986, than in 1984. We suggest that declines in both the numbers of nesting ibises and in reproductive success at the two sites resulted from the relative unavailability of crayfishes during dry periods. At Drum Island, mortality associated with food stress was exacerbated by Fish Crow (Corvus ossifragus) predation on eggs and young. Although alternative prey such as fiddler crabs are consumed by adult ibises, the osmotic concentration of these prey results in unacceptable salt loading in developing nestlings. White Ibises breeding in salt marshes along the South Carolina coast appear to depend heavily upon freshwater wetlands as a source of food for their nestlings.},

We tested this protective nesting association hypothesis by studying solitary choughs, Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax, breeding within or outside lesser kestrel, Falco naumanni, colonies in northern Spain (1993\textendash 1994). We found 27 potential predators of choughs and kestrels and confirmed predation on adults and nests of both species by at least eight common predators. We experimentally assessed the defence investment of choughs and kestrels towards a stuffed eagle owl, Bubo bubo, in 19 buildings shared by both species. Lesser kestrels were more efficient at detecting the predator, and defended more vigorously than choughs. Choughs clearly selected for breeding buildings where lesser kestrel colonies were installed. Breeding success of these choughs was much higher than that of choughs breeding alone, because of a lower percentage of nest failure. Benefits to choughs probably accrued from both the `parasitism' of the kestrels' nest defence and the dilution of predation risk in the colonies. Since lesser kestrels do not prey on choughs, this could be a good example of ￼protective nesting association in birds.},

However, observed hypervolumes (e.g., realized niches) could also have holes, defined as unoccupied hyperspace representing deviations from these expectations that may indicate unconsidered ecological or evolutionary processes. Detecting holes in more than two dimensions has to date not been possible. I develop a mathematical approach, implemented in the hypervolume R package, to infer holes in large and high-dimensional data sets.

Our paper addresses the following questions: (1) Does prevalence (percentage parasitism) differ among the three host species? (2) What are the spatial and temporal population dynamics within the community? and (3) Does the parasite exhibit size-selective behaviour in any of the three host species? Significant differences in prevalence were found among the three host species; the parasitic castrator (Hemioniscus balani) most heavily infected the least abundant host. Parasitism occurred throughout the year and also showed significant spatial variation. H. balani showed size-selective parasitism in C. fissus, but not in C. dalli. Consequently, the population effects of parasitic castration in C. fissus depend both upon the host population size structure and the intensity of the parasite's size-selectivity.},

Such interactions give rise to group living as well as many of the complex forms of cooperation and conflict that occur within animal groups. Although previous conceptual models have focused on the ecological causes and fitness consequences of variation in social interactions, recent developments in endocrinology, neuroscience, and molecular genetics offer exciting opportunities to develop more integrated research programs that will facilitate new insights into the physiological causes and consequences of social variation. Here, we propose an integrative framework of social behavior that emphasizes relationships between ultimate-level function and proximate-level mechanism, thereby providing a foundation for exploring the full diversity of factors that underlie variation in social interactions, and ultimately sociality. In addition to identifying new model systems for the study of human psychopathologies, this framework provides a mechanistic basis for predicting how social behavior will change in response to environmental variation. We argue that the study of non-model organisms is essential for implementing this integrative model of social behavior because such species can be studied simultaneously in the lab and field, thereby allowing integration of rigorously controlled experimental manipulations with detailed observations of the ecological contexts in which interactions among conspecifics occur.},

Iodide, a necessary element for thyroid hormone production, varies in diet, and is more abundant in estuarine environments, which could alter thyroid hormone variation. However, associations between thyroid hormone concentrations in animals from marine versus freshwater environments, which could become more pertinent with rising sea levels associated with global climate change, are not well studied. To determine the importance of dietary iodide in seasonal variation of plasma thyroid hormone concentrations, we analyzed seasonal variation of plasma thyroxine (T(4)) and triiodothyronine (T(3)) concentrations in juvenile alligators from an estuarine habitat (Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge; MI) and a freshwater habitat (Lake Woodruff National Wildlife Refuge; LW) and compared these results to plasma inorganic iodide (PII) concentrations. Alligators from MI did not display seasonal variation in plasma T(4), but exhibited a seasonal pattern in plasma T(3) concentrations similar to alligators from LW. Plasma thyroid hormone concentrations were consistently higher at MI than at LW. PII concentrations were correlated with plasma T(4) and T(3) concentrations in juvenile alligators from LW but not MI. The data on plasma T(4) and T(3) concentrations suggest altered iodide metabolism in estuarine alligators. Differences in thyroid hormone concentrations between the populations could be due to differences in dietary iodide, which need to be further evaluated.},

  abstract = {During embryonic development, organisms are sensitive to changes in thyroid hormone signaling which can reset the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. It has been hypothesized that this developmental programming is a `predictive adaptive response', a physiological adjustment in accordance with the embryonic environment that will best aid an individual's survival in a similar postnatal environment. When the embryonic environment is a poor predictor of the external environment, the developmental changes are no longer adaptive and can result in disease states. We predicted that endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and environmentally-based iodide imbalance could lead to developmental changes to the thyroid axis. To explore whether iodide or EDCs could alter developmental programming, we collected American alligator eggs from an estuarine environment with high iodide availability and elevated thyroid-specific EDCs, a freshwater environment contaminated with elevated agriculturally derived EDCs, and a reference freshwater environment. We then incubated them under identical conditions. We examined plasma thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentrations, thyroid gland histology, plasma inorganic iodide, and somatic growth at one week (before external nutrition) and ten months after hatching (on identical diets). Neonates from the estuarine environment were thyrotoxic, expressing follicular cell hyperplasia (p=0.01) and elevated plasma triiodothyronine concentrations (p=0.0006) closely tied to plasma iodide concentrations (p = 0.003). Neonates from the freshwater contaminated site were hypothyroid, expressing thyroid follicular cell hyperplasia (p = 0.01) and depressed plasma thyroxine concentrations (p = 0.008). Following a ten month growth period under identical conditions, thyroid histology (hyperplasia p=0.04; colloid depletion p=0.01) and somatic growth (body mass p,0.0001; length p = 0.02) remained altered among the contaminated sites. This work supports the hypothesis that embryonic EDC exposure or iodide imbalance could induce adult metabolic disease states, thereby stressing the need to consider the multiple environmental variables present during development.},

This simplification is only justified if interindividual niche variation is rare, weak, or has a trivial effect on ecological processes. This article reviews the incidence, degree, causes, and implications of individual-level niche variation to challenge these simplifications. Evidence for individual specialization is available for 93 species distributed across a broad range of taxonomic groups. Although few studies have quantified the degree to which individuals are specialized relative to their population, between-individual variation can sometimes comprise the majority of the population's niche width. The degree of individual specialization varies widely among species and among populations, reflecting a diverse array of physiological, behavioral, and ecological mechanisms that can generate intrapopulation variation. Finally, individual specialization has potentially important ecological, evolutionary, and conservation implications. Theory suggests that niche variation facilitates frequency-dependent interactions that can profoundly affect the population's stability, the amount of intraspecific competition, fitness-function shapes, and the population's capacity to diversify and speciate rapidly. Our collection of case studies suggests that individual specialization is a widespread but underappreciated phenomenon that poses many important but unanswered questions.},

  abstract = {Theory suggests that frequency-dependent resource competition will disproportionately impact the most common phenotypes in a population. The resulting disruptive selection forms the driving force behind evolutionary models of niche diversification, character release, ecological sexual dimorphism, resource polymorphism, and sympatric speciation. However, there is little empirical support for the idea that intraspecific competition generates disruptive selection. This paper presents a test of this theory, using natural populations of the three-spine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus. Sticklebacks exhibit substantial individual specialization associated with phenotypic variation and so are likely to experience frequency-dependent competition and hence disruptive selection. Using body size and relative gonad mass as indirect measures of potential fecundity and hence fitness, I show that an important aspect of trophic morphology, gill raker length, is subject to disruptive selection in one of two natural lake populations. To test whether this apparent disruptive selection could have been caused by competition, I manipulated population densities in pairs of large enclosures in each of five lakes. In each lake I removed fish from one enclosure and added them to the other to create paired low- and high-population-density treatments with natural phenotype distributions. Again using indirect measures of fitness, disruptive selection was consistently stronger in high-density than low-density enclosures. These results support long-standing theoretical arguments that intraspecific competition drives disruptive selection and thus may be an important causal agent in the evolution of ecological variation.},

  abstract = {While models of sympatric speciation are motivated in part by multi-species adaptive radiations such as the Cameroon crater lake cichlids, existing models have focused on bifurcation into a single pair of daughter species. This paper shows that a familiar model of sympatric speciation, driven by intraspecific competition and assortative mating based on ecological characters values, can yield multiple daughter species if individual niche widths are sufficiently restricted. Surprisingly, the multi-species outcome is not produced by successive bifurcation events, but by simultaneous divergence resulting in a hard polytomy. This result is sensitive to a number of assumptions, whose violation may prevent speciation. In some cases when speciation fails, the population instead ends in a state that closely resembles incipient species pairs, with an ecological polymorphism and partial reproductive isolation. However, this polymorphism is stable and does not lead to complete reproductive isolation, suggesting that empirical cases of incipient species pairs may not always end in speciation.},

  abstract = {A species's niche width reflects a balance between the diversifying effects of intraspecific competition and the constraining effects of interspecific competition. This balance shifts when a species from a competitive environment invades a depauperate habitat where interspecific competition is reduced. The resulting ecological release permits population niche expansion, via increased individual niche widths and/or increased among-individual variation. We report an experimental test of the theory of ecological release in three-spine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We factorially manipulated the presence or absence of two interspecific competitors: juvenile cut-throat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki) and prickly sculpin (Cottus asper). Consistent with the classic niche variation hypothesis, release from trout competition increased stickleback population niche width via increased among-individual variation, while individual niche widths remained unchanged. In contrast, release from sculpin competition had no effect on population niche width, because increased individual niche widths were offset by decreased between-individual variation. Our results confirm that ecological release from interspecific competition can lead to increases in niche width, and that these changes can occur on behavioural time scales. Importantly, we find that changes in population niche width are decoupled from changes in the niche widths of individuals within the population.},

Why might intraspecific variation alter ecological dynamics? In this review we synthesize recent theory and identify six general mechanisms by which trait variation changes the outcome of ecological interactions. These mechanisms include several direct effects of trait variation per se and indirect effects arising from the role of genetic variation in trait evolution.},

This association was observed only on active bird nests in a savannah area of central Namibia. On 25 checked nests, it was recorded on 5 of 5 active nests and 0 of 7 abandoned nests in savannah vegetation, never in desert areas. The wasp uses the inferior side of the bird nest aggregation, where tunnels open, as a substrate to fix the nest peduncle. The social and complex nests of P. socius are interpreted as an adaptive behaviour to reduce predation, and the presence of an aggressive associate wasp increases the defence against predators. The advantage for the wasp, besides the use of the substrate, could be the easiness of predation on flies attracted under the nest by the store of bird faeces.},

For macrophytes, salinity is one of the main factors determining distribution along estuarine environments.Urochola arrectais a Poaceae with high invasive potential in several freshwater and estuarine ecosystems. In South Brazilian estuaries, this species is found sparsely in mangroves, and invades successfully freshwaters and areas with low salinity. We experimentally described theU. arrectatolerance to salt. Furthermore, we tested if the response to the saline gradient depends on the population origin, through an experiment with populations inhabiting estuarine and freshwater ecosystems. We designed the experiment with three populations of this species, expecting that estuarine populations were more resistant to salinity. Plants grew in a salinity gradient and after 40 days we measured macrophytes biomass and length. Salinity was highly stressful forU. arrectaindependently of its origin. Even so, plant growth differed significantly among populations. Despite higher growth, the population originated from freshwater habitats presented the fastest decrease in performance indicators with increasing salinity. This result indicates short-term evolutionary changes because all populations grew common-garden conditions in our experiment. Furthermore, salinity did not prevent the full establishment of this plant, since almost all propagules developed roots even in the saline treatments. Differences among populations suggest that invasion potential of this species can be higher than predicted by the environmental conditions of current invaded sites. Constant monitoring in estuarine invaded ecosystems is central to manage invasions in critical ecosystems, such as mangroves areas.},

Themes explored include: the organisms involved, both animal and plant; how specializations evolved once mutualisms formed; how mutualisms affect population dynamics and community structure; and the role of mutualisms in different environments.

  abstract = {Populations can be genetically isolated both by geographic distance and by differences in their ecology or environment that decrease the rate of successful migration. Empirical studies often seek to investigate the relationship between genetic differentiation and some ecological variable(s) while accounting for geographic distance, but common approaches to this problem (such as the partial Mantel test) have a number of drawbacks. In this article, we present a Bayesian method that enables users to quantify the relative contributions of geographic distance and ecological distance to genetic differentiation between sampled populations or individuals. We model the allele frequencies in a set of populations at a set of unlinked loci as spatially correlated Gaussian processes, in which the covariance structure is a decreasing function of both geographic and ecological distance. Parameters of the model are estimated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We call this method Bayesian Estimation of Differentiation in Alleles by Spatial Structure and Local Ecology (BEDASSLE), and have implemented it in a user-friendly format in the statistical platform R. We demonstrate its utility with a simulation study and empirical applications to human and teosinte data sets.},

We investigated the spatial pattern of alligator holes in Water Conservation Area 3, a part of the central Everglades, and examined associations among alligator holes, canals, and hydrology. There were fewer alligator holes within 1000 m of canals than expected, supporting the hypoth- esis that Alligator mississippiensis (American Alligator) are using canals as aquatic refugia rather than creating or maintaining alligator holes in the marsh. In addition, density of holes was associated with hydrology; specifically, areas that were drier had more than twice as many alligator holes than areas that were wetter. Analyses from this study provide a baseline for evaluating changes in location and density of alligator holes in response to canal removal and hydrologic changes that will occur as part of Everglades restoration.},

Dispersal on its own is not stabilizing and can destabilize a stable local equilibrium. We identify three mechanisms whereby limited dispersal of hosts and parasitoids combined with other features, such as spatial and temporal heterogeneity, can promote increased persistence and stability. The first mechanism, ``statistical stabilization'', is simply the statistical effect that summing a number of out-of-phase population trajectories results in a relatively constant total population density. The second mechanism involves decoupling of immigration from local density, such that limited dispersal between asynchronous patches results in an effect that mimics density-dependence at the local patch level. The third mechanism involves altering spatially averaged parameter values resulting from spatial heterogeneity in density combined with non-linear responses to density. Persistence in spatially explicit models with local dispersal is frequently associated with self-organized spatial patterning.},

Our understanding of the pattern and process of coevolution, particularly of antagonistic species interactions, has been hugely advanced in recent years by an upsurge in experimental studies that directly observe coevolution in the laboratory. These experiments pose new questions by revealing novel facets of the coevolutionary process not captured by current theory, while also providing the first empirical tests of longstanding coevolutionary ideas, including the influential Red Queen hypothesis. In this article, we highlight emerging directions for this field, including experimental coevolution of mutualistic interactions and understanding how pairwise coevolutionary processes scale up within species-rich communities. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {It is widely believed that mutualisms, interspecific interactions that benefit both species, have been grossly neglected relative to their true importance in nature. I have reviewed the recent primary literature in order to assess quantitatively the frequency of studies of mutualism, the types of questions they address, and their general scientific approach. All articles appearing from 1986 to 1990 in nine major journals that publish ecological and evolutionary research were examined. It is clear that mutualism research is not in fact rare. Studies of interspecific interactions made up about 22\% of the over 4500 articles published during this period; of these, about one-quarter investigated some form of mutualism. Over 90\% of them investigated plant-animal interactions, primarily pollination (52 \%) and seed dispersal (31 \%), a bias probably related in part to the particular journals examined. The diversity of questions addressed in these articles was surprisingly low. The majority (63 \%) focused simply on identifying the mutualists of some species of interest. Furthermore, almost all studies were unilateral, that is, they focused on only one of the interacting species, plants being studied much more frequently than their animal partners. Mutualism studies do not appear to have focused on mutualism as a form of interaction in the same way as studies of competition and predation. Rather, researchers have treated mutualism primarily as a life history attribute of one of the two partners. Consequently, although an impressive amount of information has accumulated about these interactions, we are still far from achieving an overall picture that transcends the boundaries of particular taxa or combinations of taxa. Three other obstacles have prevented data on mutualisms from being brought together: the historical isolation of studies of different kinds of mutualism, a nearly total disconnection between mutualism theories and empirical studies, and the unilateral approach almost always used to study these bilateral interactions. I identify eight research questions whose answers have the potential to reveal broad-based generalizations about the evolution and ecology of mutualism.},

  abstract = {Once neglected, the role of facilitative interactions in plant communities has received considerable attention in the last two decades, and is now widely recognized. It is timely to consider the progress made by research in this field. We review the development of plant facilitation research, focusing on the history of the field, the relationship between plant2013plant interactions and environmental severity gradients, and attempts to integrate facilitation into mainstream ecological theory. We then consider future directions for facilitation research. With respect to our fundamental understanding of plant facilitation, clarification of the relationship between interactions and environmental gradients is central for further progress, and necessitates the design and implementation of experiments that move beyond the clear limitations of previous studies. There is substantial scope for exploring indirect facilitative effects in plant communities, including their impacts on diversity and evolution, and future studies should connect the degree of non-transitivity in plant competitive networks to community diversity and facilitative promotion of species coexistence, and explore how the role of indirect facilitation varies with environmental severity. Certain ecological modelling approaches (e.g. individual-based modelling), although thus far largely neglected, provide highly useful tools for exploring these fundamental processes. Evolutionary responses might result from facilitative interactions, and consideration of facilitation might lead to re-assessment of the evolution of plant growth forms. Improved understanding of facilitation processes has direct relevance for the development of tools for ecosystem restoration, and for improving our understanding of the response of plant species and communities to environmental change drivers. Attempts to apply our developing ecological knowledge would benefit from explicit recognition of the potential role of facilitative plant2013plant interactions in the design and interpretation of studies from the fields of restoration and global change ecology. Synthesis: Plant facilitation research provides new insights into classic ecological theory and pressing environmental issues. Awareness and understanding of facilitation should be part of the basic ecological knowledge of all plant ecologists.},

Now we describe GeneMark-EP, a tool that utilizes another source of external information, a protein database, readily available prior to the start of a sequencing project. A new specialized pipeline, ProtHint, initiates massive protein mapping to genome and extracts hints to splice sites and translation start and stop sites of potential genes. GeneMark-EP uses the hints to improve estimation of model parameters as well as to adjust coordinates of predicted genes if they disagree with the most reliable hints (the -EP+ mode). Tests of GeneMarkEP and -EP+ demonstrated improvements in gene prediction accuracy in comparison with GeneMarkES, while the GeneMark-EP+ showed higher accuracy than GeneMark-ET. We have observed that the most pronounced improvements in gene prediction accuracy happened in large eukaryotic genomes.},

Only a few genomes could serve as standards of annotation achieved through a tremendous investment of human curation efforts. Still, the correctness of all alternative isoforms, even in the best-annotated genomes, could be a good subject for further investigation. The new BRAKER2 pipeline generates and integrates external protein support into the iterative process of training and gene prediction by GeneMark-EP+ and AUGUSTUS. BRAKER2 continues the line started by BRAKER1 where self-training GeneMark-ET and AUGUSTUS made gene predictions supported by transcriptomic data. Among the challenges addressed by the new pipeline was a generation of reliable hints to proteincoding exon boundaries from likely homologous but evolutionarily distant proteins. In comparison with other pipelines for eukaryotic genome annotation, BRAKER2 is fully automatic. It is favorably compared under equal conditions with other pipelines, e.g. MAKER2, in terms of accuracy and performance. Development of BRAKER2 should facilitate solving the task of harmonization of annotation of proteincoding genes in genomes of different eukaryotic species. However, we fully understand that several more innovations are needed in transcriptomic and proteomic technologies as well as in algorithmic development to reach the goal of highly accurate annotation of eukaryotic genomes.},

This special feature showcases the state-of-the art knowledge on eco-evolutionary dynamics and dissects the feedback types, the biological and spatial scales as well as the agents of selection underlying the interactions between ecology and evolution. Theoretical approaches to eco-evolutionary feedbacks can draw on a wide range of fields and have a long history within evolutionary ecology. The integration of theoretical approaches from quantitative genetics, evolutionary ecology, and metapopulation ecology is necessary to advance our understanding of rapid evolution and associated eco-evolutionary dynamics. Empirical studies in this special feature focus on the evolution-to-ecology pathway by which evolutionary processes influence ecological dynamics (the direction in eco-evolutionary dynamics less well studied). Advancing towards the study of complete (i.e. reciprocal) eco-evolutionary feedbacks requires unravelling both the ecology-to-evolution and the evolution-to-ecology pathways in isolation and understanding how they are coupled. This endeavour will require a combination of laboratory, semi-natural (e.g. mesocosm) and field studies. As the field of eco-evolutionary dynamics matures, it moves from proof-of-principle studies to understanding increasingly complex biological systems. This Special Feature provides necessary tools and approaches, both theoretical and empirical, to achieve this new aim.},

Exploiters may drive sympatric (within-population) diversification if there are a variety of exploiter-resistance strategies or fitness costs associated with exploiter resistance. Exploiters may also drive allopatric (between-population) diversification by creating different selection pressures and increasing the rate of random divergence. We examined the effect of a virulent viral parasite (phage) on the diversification of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens in spatially structured microcosms. Here we show that in the absence of phages, bacteria rapidly diversified into spatial niche specialists with similar patterns of diversity across replicate populations. In the presence of phages, sympatric diversity was greatly reduced, as a result of phage-imposed reductions in host density decreasing competition for resources. In contrast, allopatric diversity was greatly increased as a result of phage-imposed selection for resistance, which caused populations to follow divergent evolutionary trajectories. These results show that exploiters can drive diversification between populations, but may inhibit diversification within populations by opposing diversifying selection that arises from resource competition.},

We evaluated factors determining the energetic limitations of brown trout (Salmo trutta) in both their native and introduced ranges. Our focus was on brown trout because they are nearly globally distributed, considered one of the world's worst invaders, yet imperiled in much of their native habitat. We synthesized and compared data describing temperature regime, diet, growth, and maximum body size across multiple spatial and temporal scales, from country (both exotic and native habitats) and major geographic area (MGA) to rivers and years within MGA. Using these data as inputs, we next used bioenergetic efficiency (BioEff), a relative scalar representing a realized percentage of maximum possible consumption (0-100\%) as our primary response variable and a multi-scale, nested, mixed statistical model (GLIMMIX) to evaluate variation among and within spatial scales and as a function of density and elevation. MGA and year (the residual) explained the greatest proportion of variance in BioEff. Temperature varied widely among MGA and was a strong driver of variation in BioEff. We observed surprisingly little variation in the diet of brown trout, except the overwhelming influence of the switch to piscivory observed only in exotic MGA. We observed only a weak signal of density-dependent effects on BioEff; however, BioEff remained {$<$} 50\% at densities {$>$} 2.5 fish/m2. The trajectory of BioEff across the life span of the fish elucidated the substantial variation in performance among MGAs; the maximum body size attained by brown trout was consistently below 400 mm in native habitat but reached approximately 600 mm outside their native range, where brown trout grew rapidly, feeding in part on naive prey fishes. The integrative, physiological approach, in combination with the intercontinental and comparative nature of our study, allowed us to overcome challenges associated with context-dependent variation in determining invasion success. Overall our results indicate "growth plasticity across the life span" was important for facilitating invasion, and should be added to lists of factors characterizing successful invaders.},

  abstract = {For a long time, respiratory proteins have been considered unnecessary in most insects because the tracheal system was thought to be sufficient for oxygen supply. Only a few species that survive under hypoxic conditions were known exceptions. However, recently it has become evident that (1) intracellular hemoglobins belong to the standard repertoire of insects and (2) that hemocyanin is present in many ``lower'' insects. Intracellular hemoglobins have been identified in Drosophila, Anopheles, Apis and many other insects. In all investigated species, hemoglobin is mainly expressed in the fat body and the tracheal system. The major Drosophila hemoglobin binds oxygen with high affinity. This hemoglobin type possibly functions as a buffer system for oxygen supply at low partial pressures and/or for the protection from an excess of oxygen. Similar hemoglobins, present in much higher concentrations, store oxygen in specialized tracheal organs of the botfly and some backswimmers. The extracellular hemoglobins in the hemolymph of chironomid midges are evolutionary derivatives of the intracellular insect hemoglobins, which emerged in response to the hypoxic environment of the larvae. In addition, several hemoglobin variants of unknown functions have been discovered in insect genomes. Hemocyanins transport oxygen in the hemolymph of stoneflies, but also in the Entognatha and most hemimetabolan taxa. Apparently, hemocyanin has been lost in Holometabola. At present, no physiological or morphological character is known that could explain the presence or loss of hemocyanins in distinct taxa. Nevertheless, the occurrence of respiratory proteins in insects adds further complexity to our view on insect respiration. r 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

There is a clear philosophy, a sound criterion based in information theory, and a rigorous statistical foundation for AIC. AIC can be justified as Bayesian using a ``savvy'' prior on models that is a function of sample size and the number of model parameters. Furthermore, BIC can be derived as a non- Bayesian result. Therefore, arguments about using AIC versus BIC for model selection cannot be from a Bayes versus frequentist perspective. The philosophical context of what is assumed about reality, approximating models, and the intent of model-based infer- ence should determine whether AIC or BIC is used. Various facets of such multimodel inference are presented here, particularly methods of model averaging.},

Here we show rapid adaptive divergence of experimentally evolving feather lice in response to preening, the main host defense. We demonstrate that host defense exerts strong phenotypic selection for crypsis in lice transferred to different colored rock pigeons (Columba livia). During four years of experimental evolution (\textasciitilde{} 60 generations), the lice evolved heritable differences in color. The color differences spanned the phenotypic distribution of congeneric species of lice adapted to other species of pigeons. Our results indicate that host-mediated selection triggers rapid divergence in the adaptive radiation of parasites, which are among the most diverse organisms on earth. Our research suggests that host defense should be included with competition and predation as a major mechanism driving the evolution of biodiversity by adaptive radiation.},

  abstract = {1. Measuring the metabolic rate of animals in the field (FMR) is central to the work of ecologists in many disciplines. In this article we discuss the pros and cons of the two most commonly used methods for measuring FMR. 2. Both methods are constantly under development, but at the present time can only accurately be used to estimate the mean rate of energy expenditure of groups of animals. The doubly labelled water method (DLW) uses stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen to trace the flow of water and carbon dioxide through the body over time. From these data, it is possible to derive a single estimate of the rate of oxygen consumption ({\.V}O2 ) for the duration of the experiment. The duration of the experiment will depend on the rate of flow of isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen through the body, which in turn depends on the animal's size, ranging from 24 h for small vertebrates to up to 28 days in Humans. 3. This technique has been used widely, partly as a result of its relative simplicity and potential low cost, though there is some uncertainty over the determination of the standard error of the estimate of mean {\.V}O2 . 4. The heart rate \$(f\_\{\textbackslash text\{H\}\})\$ method depends on the physiological relationship between heart rate and {\.V}O2 . 5. If these two quantities are calibrated against each other under controlled conditions. \$f\_\{\textbackslash text\{H\}\}\$ can then be measured in free-ranging animals and used to estimate {\.V}O2 . 6. The latest generation of small implantable data loggers means that it is possible to measure \$f\_\{\textbackslash text\{H\}\}\$ for over a year on a very fine temporal scale, though the current size of the data loggers limits the size of experimental animals to around 1 kg. However, externally mounted radio-transmitters are now sufficiently small to be used with animals of less than 40 g body mass. This technique is gaining in popularity owing to its high accuracy and versatility, though the logistic constraint of performing calibrations can make its use a relatively extended process.},

Yet its applicability has been severely criticized, mainly because the original model assumed a strict competitive hierarchy of species and did not allow for any preemptive effect. We considered the impact of relaxing both of these limitations on coexistence. Relaxing trade-off intensity makes coexistence less likely and introduces a minimum colonization rate below which any coexistence is impossible. Allowing for preemption introduces a limit to dissimilarity between species. Surprisingly, preemption does not impede coexistence as one could presume from previous studies, but can actually increase the likelihood of coexistence. Its effect on coexistence depends on whether or not species in the regional pool are strongly limited in their colonization ability. Preemption is predicted to favour coexistence when: (i) species are not strongly limited in their colonization ability; and (ii) the competitive trade-off is not infinitely intense. \textcopyright{} 2006 The Authors.},

By extension, we can predict that competition should lead to density-dependent natural selection. I studied natural selection on limb length and body size in a total of seven populations of Anolis sagrei over 3 years in the Bahamas. Experimental manipulations of population density on small off-shore cays revealed that the strength of natural selection on body size increased with density, suggesting that density-dependent intraspecific competition drives natural selection. At low density, reduced competition revealed significant selection on limb length driven by changes in perch diameter, indicating that selection favoured a match between morphology and habitat. The role habitat played in shaping selection was further illuminated by inter-annual changes in vegetation structure stemming from variation in precipitation among years. Thus, changes in both the intensity of competition across spatial replicates, and in resource availability through time, revealed changes in the targets of natural selection. Results provide empirical support for the long-standing hypothesis that density-dependent natural selection shapes the fitness surface of Greater Antilles anoles.},

All alligator holes were circular in shape and excavated to flat limestone substrate. Nine natural alligator holes were associated with tree islands and 11 were surrounded by sawgrass marsh. Man-made alligator holes were adjacent to islands constructed as high water refugia for deer. Marsh alligator holes were smaller and shallower than alligator holes associated with tree islands. Alligator hole size was correlated with water depth. Alligator holes surrounded by marsh had less diversified surroundings and lower species richness than alligator holes associated with tree islands. Alligator holes contained species of vegetation not found in the surrounding marsh. Seventy-nine percent of the alligator holes had signs of recent activity by alligators. Larger alligator holes associated with tree islands had adult and hatchling alligators and smaller marsh alligator holes contained juvenile alligators.

  abstract = {Abstract The estuarine crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) is the apex-predator in waterways and coastlines throughout south-east Asia and Australasia. C. porosus pose a potential risk to humans, and management strategies are implemented to control their movement and distribution. Here we used GPS-based telemetry to accurately record geographical location of adult C. porosus during the breeding and nesting season. The purpose of the study was to assess how C. porosus movement and distribution may be influenced by localised social conditions. During breeding, the females (2.9260.013 metres total length (TL), mean 6 S.E., n = 4) occupied an area,1 km length of river, but to nest they travelled up to 54 km away from the breeding area. All tagged male C. porosus sustained high rates of movement (6.4960.9 km d21; n = 8) during the breeding and nesting period. The orientation of the daily movements differed between individuals revealing two discontinuous behavioural strategies. Five tagged male C. porosus (4.1760.14 m TL) exhibited a `site-fidelic' strategy and moved within well-defined zones around the female home range areas. In contrast, three males (3.8160.08 m TL) exhibited `nomadic' behaviour where they travelled continually throughout hundreds of kilometres of waterway. We argue that the `site-fidelic' males patrolled territories around the female home ranges to maximise reproductive success, whilst the `nomadic' males were subordinate animals that were forced to range over a far greater area in search of unguarded females. We conclude that C. porosus are highly mobile animals existing within a complex social system, and mate/con-specific interactions are likely to have a profound effect upon population density and distribution, and an individual's travel potential. We recommend that impacts on socio-spatial behaviour are considered prior to the implementation of management interventions.},

Advantages for the protected species are usually manifested in terms of higher reproductive success than conspecifics nesting remote to the protector species. Whether the protector species also accrues any benefit remains untested, and the species-specific behavioral traits underlying enhanced reproductive output in mixed-species associations remain poorly docu- mented. We studied associations between lesser kestrels (Falco naumanni) and jackdaws (Corvus monedula) nesting in rural buildings in the Gela Plain (Italy). We tested for interspecific interactions of jackdaws and lesser kestrels by comparing single- and mixed-species colonies in terms of: 1) vigilance, nest attendance, and intra- and interspecific interference and 2) defensive responses shown by each species when confronted with potential predators or competitors. In both species, nesting in mixed associations was accompanied by decreased vigilance. Diminished vigilance, however, was associated with decreased defensive effort for lesser kestrels, whereas jackdaws increased alarm calling, but only in small colonies. Our results reveal a reciprocal influence on behavior of lesser kestrels and jackdaws nesting within the same colony, whereby both species experience decreased energetic expenditures associated with vigilance, but only lesser kestrels appear to benefit via reduced nest defense effort. We discuss our results in light of the possible asymmetrical information transfer triggered by a common set of nest predators that favors the exchange of interspecific information regarding predator detection and defense.},

Its purpose is to allow investigators to independently annotate eukaryotic genomes and create genome databases. MAKER identifies repeats, aligns ESTs and proteins to a genome, produces ab initio gene predictions, and automatically synthesizes these data into gene annotations having evidence-based quality indices. MAKER is also easily trainable: Outputs of preliminary runs are used to automatically retrain its gene-prediction algorithm, producing higher-quality gene-models on subsequent runs. MAKER's inputs are minimal, and its outputs can be used to create a GMOD database. Its outputs can also be viewed in the Apollo Genome browser; this feature of MAKER provides an easy means to annotate, view, and edit individual contigs and BACs without the overhead of a database. As proof of principle, we have used MAKER to annotate the genome of the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea and to create a new genome database, SmedGD. We have also compared MAKER's performance to other published annotation pipelines. Our results demonstrate that MAKER provides a simple and effective means to convert a genome sequence into a community-accessible genome database. MAKER should prove especially useful for emerging model organism genome projects for which extensive bioinformatics resources may not be readily available.},

Presented here is an improved procedure for estimating the largest value for tau that is consistent with this condition.

  abstract = {Apidae is the most speciose and behaviorally diverse family of bees. It includes solitary, eusocial, socially parasitic, and an exceptionally high proportion of deptoparasitic species. Cleptoparasitic bees, which are brood parasites in the nests of other bees, have long caused problems in resolving the phylogenetic relationships within Apidae based on morphological data because of the tendency for parasites to coverge on a suite of traits, making it difficult to differentiate similarity caused by common ancestry from convergence. Here, we resolve the evolutionary history of apid cleptoparasitism by conducting a detailed, comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analysis of all 33 apid tribes (based on 190 species), including representatives from every hypothesized origin of cleptoparasitism. Based on Bayesian ancestral state reconstruction, we show that cleptoparasitism has arisen just four times in Apidae, which is fewer times than previously estimated. Our results indicate that 99\% of cleptoparasitic apid bees form a monophyletic group. Divergence time estimates reveal that cleptoparasitism is an ancient behavior in bees that first evolved in the late Cretaceous 95 Mya [95\% highest posterior density (HPD) = 87-103]. Our phylogenetic analysis of the Apidae sheds light on the macroevolution of a bee family that is of evolutionary, ecological, and economic importance.},

  abstract = {Facilitation between species is thought to be a key mechanism by which biodiversity affects the rates of resource use that govern the efficiency and productivity of ecosystems; however, there is no direct empirical evidence to support this hypothesis. Here we show that increasing the species diversity of a functional group of aquatic organisms induces facilitative interactions, leading to non-additive changes in resource consumption. We increased the richness and evenness of suspension-feeding caddisfly larvae (Insecta, Trichoptera) in stream mesocosms and found that the increased topographical complexity of the benthic habitat alters patterns of near-bed flow such that the feeding success of individuals is enhanced. Species diversity reduces 'current shading' (that is, the deceleration of flow from upstream to downstream neighbours), allowing diverse assemblages to capture a greater fraction of suspended resources than is caught by any species monoculture. The fundamental nature of this form of hydrodynamic facilitation suggests that it is broadly applicable to freshwater and marine habitats; in addition, it has several analogues in terrestrial ecosystems where fluxes of energy and matter can be influenced by biophysical complexity. Thus, changes in species diversity may alter the probability of positive species interactions, resulting in disproportionately large changes in the functioning of ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Notwithstanding their biological importance, Y chromosomes remain poorly known in most species. A major obstacle to their study is the identification of Y chromosome sequences; due to its high content of repetitive DNA, in most genome projects, the Y chromosome sequence is fragmented into a large number of small, unmapped scaffolds. Identification of Y-linked genes among these fragments has yielded important insights about the origin and evolution of Y chromosomes, but the process is labor intensive, restricting studies to a small number of species. Apart from these fragmentary as- semblies, in a few mammalian species, the euchromatic sequence of the Y is essentially complete, owing to painstaking BAC mapping and sequencing. Here we use female short-read sequencing and k-mer comparison to identify Y-linked sequences in two very different genomes, Drosophila virilis and human. Using this method, essentially all D. virilis scaffolds were unambiguously classified as Y-linked or not Y-linked. We found 800 new scaffolds (totaling 8.5 Mbp), and four new genes in the Y chromosome of D. virilis, including JYalpha, a gene involved in hybrid male sterility. Our results also strongly support the preponderance of gene gains over gene losses in the evolution of the Drosophila Y. In the intensively studied human genome, used here as a positive control, we recovered all previously known genes or gene families, plus a small amount (283 kb) of new, unfinished sequence. Hence, this method works in large and complex genomes and can be applied to any species with sex chromosomes.},

Nevertheless, most recent genome assemblies remain incomplete and fragmented. While long molecule sequencing promises to deliver more complete genome assemblies with fewer gaps, concerns about error rates, low yields, stringent DNA requirements and uncertainty about best practices may discourage many investigators from adopting this technology. Here, in conjunction with the platinum standard Drosophila melanogaster reference genome, we analyze recently published long molecule sequencing data to identify what governs completeness and contiguity of genome assemblies. We also present a hybrid metaassembly approach that achieves remarkable assembly contiguity for both Drosophila and human assemblies with only modest long molecule sequencing coverage. Our results motivate a set of preliminary best practices for obtaining accurate and contiguous assemblies, a `missing manual' that guides key decisions in building high quality de novo genome assemblies, from DNA isolation to polishing the assembly.},

  abstract = {Experimental evolution studies, coupled with new advances in DNA sequencing technology, have become a powerful tool for exploring how populations respond to selection at the genomic level. Recent experiments in microbes typically have found evidence for multiple novel mutations, which are usually fixed. In contrast, in animal model systems, evolutionary responses seem to involve more modest changes in the frequencies of pre-existing alleles, probably because these populations outcross and are usually initialized with greater levels of standing variation. In this experiment, I used whole-genome resequencing to estimate allele frequencies and look for novel substitutions in experimentally evolved populations of Caenorhabditis elegans . These populations were founded with a fixed pair of deleterious mutations introgressed into multiple wild genetic backgrounds and allowed to evolve for 50 generations with a mixed mating system. There is evidence for some recombination between ancestral haplotypes, but selective sweeps seem to have resulted in the fixation of large chromosomal segments throughout most of the genome. In addition, a few new mutations were detected. Simulations suggest that strong selection and low outcrossing rates are likely explanations for the observed outcomes, consistent with earlier work showing large fitness increases in these populations over 50 generations. These results also show clear parallels to population genetic patterns in C. elegans in nature: recent selective sweeps, high linkage disequilibrium, and low effective recombination rates. Thus, the genomic consequences of selection depend heavily on the biology of the organism in question, including its mating system and levels of genetic variation.},

Although not fully explored, nectar yeasts also constitute a promising natural microcosm that can be used to facilitate development of general ecological theory. We discuss the methodological and conceptual advantages of using nectar yeasts from this perspective, including simplicity of communities, tractability of dispersal, replicability of community assembly, and the ease with which the mechanisms of species interactions can be studied in complementary experiments conducted in the field and the laboratory. To illustrate the power of nectar yeasts as a study system, we discuss several topics in community ecology, including environmental filtering, priority effects, and metacommunity dynamics. An exciting new direction is to integrate metagenomics and comparative genomics into nectar yeast research to address these fundamental ecological topics.},

  abstract = {Competition and predation are the most heavily investigated species interactions in ecology, dominating studies of species diversity maintenance. However, these two interactions are most commonly viewed highly asymmetrically. Competition for resources is seen as the primary interaction limiting diversity, with predation modifying what competition does, although theoretical models have long supported diverse views. Here we show, using a comprehensive three-trophic-level model, that competition and predation should be viewed symmetrically: these two interactions are equally able to either limit or promote diversity. Diversity maintenance requires within-species density feedback loops to be stronger than between-species feedback loops. We quantify the contributions of predation and competition to these loops in a simple, interpretable form, showing their equivalent potential to strengthen or weaken diversity maintenance. Moreover, we show that competition and predation can undermine each other, with the tendency of the stronger interaction to promote or limit diversity prevailing. The past failure to appreciate the symmetrical effects and interactions of competition and predation has unduly restricted diversity maintenance studies. A multitrophic perspective should be adopted to examine a greater variety of possible effects of predation than generally considered in the past. Conservation and management strategies need to be much more concerned with the implications of changes in the strengths of trophic interactions. \textcopyright 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  abstract = {Community assembly provides a conceptual foundation for understanding the processes that determine which and how many species live in a particular locality. Evidence suggests that community assembly often leads to a single stable equilibrium, such that the conditions of the environment and interspecific interactions determine which species will exist there. In such cases, regions of local communities with similar environmental conditions should have similar community composition. Other evidence suggests that community assembly can lead to multiple stable equilibria. Thus, the resulting community depends on the assembly history, even when all species have access to the community. In these cases, a region of local communities with similar environmental conditions can be very dissimilar in their community composition. Both regional and local factors should determine the patterns by which communities assemble, and the resultant degree of similarity or dissimilarity among localities with similar environments. A single equilibrium in more likely to be realized in systems with small regional species pools, high rates of connectance, low productivity and high disturbance. Multiple stable equilibria are more likely in systems with large regional species pools, low rates of connectance, high productivity and low disturbance. I illustrate preliminary evidence for these predictions from an observational study of small pond communities, and show important effects on community similarity, as well as on local and regional species richness.},

Condition was inversely correlated with date of return and positively related to breeding experience in males, but not in females. In both sexes, condition displayed year-to-year variations; the 1991-1992 season was distinguished by poor condition, low incidence of breeding, and low reproductive success. Condition in both males and females, and breeding experience in males had significant effects on the "decision to breed." Breeding experience also influenced the decision to breed, especially in males. Condition, but not breeding ex- perience, had a significant influence on male incubation success. Female breeding perfor- mances were not related to condition but to breeding experience. Annual average breeding success was highly variable and significantly correlated with male condition. Prebreeding visits appeared to be critical for this pelagic seabird and may allow individuals, through their condition, to manage their reproductive investment. We suggest that condition mainly affects egg formation in females and, together with breeding experience, influences the duration and the quality of prebreeding colony attendance in males. The potential relationships of body condition, breeding experience, reproductive investment, and future survival are dis- cussed.},

Existing error correction tools cannot correct nanopore reads efficiently and effectively. Most methods trim high-error-rate subsequences during error correction, which reduces both the length of the reads and contiguity of the final assembly. Here, we develop an error correction, and de novo assembly tool designed to overcome complex errors in nanopore reads. We propose an adaptive read selection and two-step progressive method to quickly correct nanopore reads to high accuracy. We introduce a two-stage assembler to utilize the full length of nanopore reads. Our tool achieves superior performance in both error correction and de novo assembling nanopore reads. It requires only 8122\,hours to assemble a 35X coverage human genome and achieves a 2.47-fold improvement in NG50. Furthermore, our assembly of the human WERI cell line shows an NG50 of 22 Mbp.

  abstract = {The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexis- tence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantifica- tion shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific inter- actions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are es- sential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms. Models of unstable coexitence, in which species diversity slowly decays over time, have focused almost exclusively on equalizing mechanisms. These models would be more robust if they also included stabilizing mechanisms, which arise in many and varied ways but need not be adequate for full stability of a system. Models of unstable coex- istence invite a broader view of diversity maintenance incorporating species turnover},

  abstract = {A general model of competitive and apparent competitive interactions in a spatially-variable environment is developed and analyzed to extend findings on coexistence in a temporally-variable environment to the spatial case and to elucidate new principles. In particular, coexistence mechanisms are divided into variation-dependent and variation-independent mechanisms with variation-dependent mechanisms including spatial generalizations of relative nonlinearity and the storage effect. Although directly analogous to the corresponding temporal mechanisms, these spatial mechanisms involve different life history traits which suggest that the spatial storage effect should arise more commonly than the temporal storage effect and spatial relative nonlinearity should arise less commonly than temporal relative nonlinearity. Additional mechanisms occur in the spatial case due to spatial covariance between the finite rate of increase of a local population and its local abundance, which has no clear temporal analogue. A limited analysis of these additional mechanisms shows that they have similar properties to the storage effect and relative nonlinearity and potentially may be considered as enlargements of the earlier mechanisms. The rate of increase of a species perturbed to low density is used to quantify coexistence. A general quadratic approximation, which is exact in some important cases, divides this rate of increase into contributions from the various mechanisms above and admits no other mechanisms, suggesting that opportunities for coexistence in a spatially-variable environment are fully characterized by these mechanisms within this general model. Three spatially-implicit models are analyzed as illustrations of the general findings and of techniques using small variance approximations. The contributions to coexistence of the various mechanisms are expressed in terms of simple interpretable formulae. These spatially-implicit models include a model of an annual plant community, a spatial multispecies version of the lottery model, and a multispecies model of an insect community competing for spatially-patchy and ephemeral food. \textcopyright{} 2000 Academic Press.},

  abstract = {A quantitative approach to species coexistence based on the invasibility criterion has led to an appreciation of coexistence mechanisms in terms of stabilizing and equalizing components, but major challenges are the need to consider general multispecies settings, interactions beyond competition, and multiple scales of space and time. Moreover, two essential concepts, species-level average fitness and scaling factors, have not had clear definitions. A general approach to defining average fitnesses and scaling factors is given, along with the origin of stabilizing mechanisms as deviations from a reference model where no coexistence is possible. Illustrations are general Lotka\textendash Volterra models, models accounting specifically for resource use and natural enemies, and models with temporal fluctuations. Community averages of stabilizing mechanisms reveal overall opportunities for coexistence, and define mechanisms more precisely through their formulae. Average fitnesses adjusted for the presence of coexistence mechanisms provide a better definition of equalizing mechanisms. While these ideas apply to the components of invasion rates, permanence theory and stochastic persistence theory show how invasion rates can be used to demonstrate species coexistence in complex settings. Although species coexistence has often focused on competition, detailed models of the roles of natural enemies provide a new perspective on the opportunities for coexistence in nature. The concept of apparent competition recognizes the essential symmetry between density-dependence from resource depletion and from supporting natural enemies. Natural enemy partitioning is the natural analogue of resource partitioning and has an equivalent role in promoting coexistence. Rather than reinforcing each other, however, the strength of coexistence is often intermediate between that implied by resource partitioning alone and that implied by natural enemy partitioning alone, as elucidated by recent Lotka\textendash Volterra theory. Synthesis. Although there are alternative approaches for understanding coexistence in multispecies settings, ideas based on stabilizing and equalizing mechanisms continue to provide new insights. Multiple species and multiple trophic levels are naturally challenging, but the new theories of permanence and stochastic persistence support the critical role of invasion rates in species coexistence, and thus support the understanding to be derived by partitioning invasion rates into average fitness differences and stabilizing components.},

  abstract = {Lake Vyrnwy is a reservoir surrounded by many types of habitat including newly afforested areas suitable for field voles. Other areas form ecological barriers between these populations. The purpose of the present inquiry was to discover the causes of the periodic fluctuations in numbers which occur, often simultaneously, among such vole populations. Several separate vole populations reached peak densities in 1937 and declined in 1938, in which year numbers were at a peak in most of the younger plantations. During the peak breeding season of 1937 there was an excessive juvenile mortality before August. The survival rate of the young then improved and the old animals became scarce, as they usually do at this time of year. All age groups ceased breeding in August 1937 and the survivors did not breed next spring. By contrast, populations which were at peak densities in 1938 continued breeding from May to October and the survivors bred again in 1939, though no recovery in numbers was brought about. Both in May 1937 and May 1938 high numbers were associated with unusually high body weights. A sample population was studied by marking and recapturing the animals. Most spent their lives within an area of 10 to 15 yd. diameter. Both in September 1936 and 1937 there were about 300 young voles per acre. During 1938 survival was very poor from January onwards, particularly among the males. During the time of their almost complete disappearance in 1938 or 1939 voles were not subjected to any known environmental conditions likely to have caused excessive mortality. The hypothesis is therefore advanced that death was primarily due to adverse conditions to which the parents were subjected in the previous breeding season. It is inferred (               a               ) that the high juvenile mortality at that time was a symptom of severe intraspecific strife, (               b               ) that intraspecific strife had deleterious effects, probably upon the hormone balance of the females, so that (               c               ) their young suffered defects which reduced the longevity of those which survived the breeding season, and also (               d               ) impaired their ability to produce a normal generation. Peak numbers were reached simultaneously over wider areas than seems likely by chance alone. It is argued that this must have occurred through some interaction of the independent biological units with their common weather system. Competition for space, the process believed to control excessive increase, is shown to be a possible means through which environmental changes may cause further variations in mortality rates. A sufficiently variable physical environment should thus tend to eliminate differences in density between populations and so to effect a regional synchrony of their cycles. It seems likely that periodic mortality in the North American snowshoe hare is also a delayed result of intraspecific strife. This extension of the hypothesis has implications which are at variance with some of the existing views about cycles in birds and mammals.},

Morphological abnormalities in parasitized aphids such as complete apterization (development of a wingless form), formation of rudimentary wing buds, and deformed wings indicate a possible disruption of the endocrine system. Changes in the body shape and the number of olfactory secondary rhinaria on the antennae could indicate an influence of juvenile hormone in parasitized A. pisum but the development of fifth-stadium supernumerary larvae (indicated by an extra moult and which can be induced by exogenous juvenile hormone treatments) was not found in parasitized aphids. In addition, while apterization of virginoparae can also be induced by the pro-allatocidal compound Precocene III, this was not possible in the male. Males which survived parasitoid attack without forming aphid mummies (indicating that oviposition had not occurred) developed as wingless individuals suggesting that the reproductive-tract-fluids from the female parasitoid were important in the wing inhibition process. Teratocytes from the parasitoid appeared to promote developmental arrest in parasitized aphids. \textcopyright{} 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

For animals with different feeding ecologies, it may be expected that bite force represents an important evolutionary adaptation, but studies have been constrained by a lack of bite force data. In this study we present predictions of bite forces for 151 species of extant carnivores, comprising representatives from all eight families and the entire size and ecological spectrum within the order. We show that, when normalized for body size, bite forces differ significantly between the various feeding categories. At opposing extremes and independent of genealogy, consumers of tough fibrous plant material and carnivores preying on large prey both have high bite forces for their size, while bite force adjusted for body mass is low among specialized insectivores. Omnivores and carnivores preying on small prey have more moderate bite forces for their size. These findings indicate that differences in bite force represent important adaptations to and indicators of differing feeding ecologies throughout carnivoran evolution. Our results suggest that the incorporation of bite force data may assist in the construction of more robust evolutionary and palaeontological analyses of feeding ecology.},

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the yellow warbler (Dendroicapetechia) derives any benefits from nesting in close prox- imity to its own and other species in reducing predator pressure or the incidence of brood parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater). 2. Yellow warblers nesting synchronously with their own and with neigh- bouring species resulted in a proportionate reduction in the number of nests preyed upon, suggesting a ' swamping effect' of the local predators. A signifi- cantly lower incidence of predation occurred at yellow warbler nests which were inside a gray catbird (Dumetella carolinensis) response range. This was thought to be the result of yellow warblers taking advantage of the catbird's nest-guarding behaviour and aggressive responses to predators. 3. Yellow warblers nesting synchronously with other yellow warblers were subject to a proportionately lower incidence of brood parasitism than asynchronous nests, suggesting a ' swamping effect' on the cowbird. A signifi- cantly lower incidence of brood parasitism occurred at yellow warbler nests which were in a red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) response range. The yellow warbler was thought to be taking advantage of the aggressive response of red-winged blackbirds to cowbirds. 4. Overall, yellow warblers which nested within the response range of red-winged blackbirds or gray catbirds had significantly higher nest success than other yellow warblers. This suggests that selection for defence against predators and cowbirds may lead to multi-species aggregations.},

  abstract = {Currently, one of the most important challenges is to provide sufficient and affordable food and energy for a fast-growing world population, alongside preserving natural habitats and maintaining biodiversity. About 35\% of the global food production depends on animals for pollination. In recent years, an alarming worldwide decline in pollinators has been reported, putting our food production under additional pressure. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find sustainable ways to ensure this crucial ecosystem service. Recent studies have shown that floral nectar is generally colonized by microorganisms, specifically yeasts and bacteria, which may alter nectar chemistry and enhance attraction of pollinators. In this study, we investigated changes in pollinator foraging behavior and pollination success in European pear (Pyrus communis L.) cultivars 'Regal Red' and 'Sweet Sensation' (red sports of 'Doyenn\'e de Comice') after flower inoculation with the typical nectar-inhabiting microorganisms Metschnikowia reukaufii and Acinetobacter nectaris, and a combination of both. Pollination success was monitored by measuring the number of flower visits, fruit set and seed set in two consecutive years, 2019 and 2020. Results revealed that application of a mixture of M. reukaufii and A. nectaris resulted in significantly higher visitation rates of honeybees and hoverflies. By contrast, no effects on flower visits were found when yeasts and bacteria were applied separately. Fruit set and seed set were not significantly affected by any of the inoculation treatments. The only factors affecting fruit set were initial number of flower clusters on the trees and the year. The absence of treatment effects can most likely be attributed to the fact that pollination was not a limiting factor for fruit set in our experiments. Altogether, our results show that inoculation of flowers with nectar microbes can modify pollinator foraging patterns, but did not lead to increased pollination success under the conditions tested.},

We followed 20 winter mixed-species flocks in North-Central Florida and assessed angular-angular correlations between overall flock, TUTI, and satellite species movement directions. We observed significant correlations between overall flock movement directions and those of TUTI, confirming our central prediction. Within flocks, however, fine-scale movement directions of satellite species were often more highly correlated with those of other satellites than with TUTI movements. We conclude that TUTI are passive nuclear species whose movements define flock paths, but within flocks, TUTI movements may have less influence on satellite movements than do other factors.}

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Generating high-quality de novo genome assemblies is foundational to the genomics study of model and non-model organisms. In recent years, long-read sequencing has greatly benefited genome assembly and scaffolding, a process by which assembled sequences are ordered and oriented through the use of long-range information. Long reads are better able to span repetitive genomic regions compared to short reads, and thus have tremendous utility for resolving problematic regions and helping generate more complete draft assemblies. Here, we present LongStitch, a scalable pipeline that corrects and scaffolds draft genome assemblies exclusively using long reads. Results:\hspace{0.6em} LongStitch incorporates multiple tools developed by our group and runs in up to three stages, which includes initial assembly correction (Tigmint-long), followed by two incremental scaffolding stages (ntLink and ARKS-long). Tigmint-long and ARKS-long are misassembly correction and scaffolding utilities, respectively, previously developed for linked reads, that we adapted for long reads. Here, we describe the LongStitch pipeline and introduce our new long-read scaffolder, ntLink, which utilizes lightweight minimizer mappings to join contigs. LongStitch was tested on short and long-read assemblies of Caenorhabditis elegans, Oryza sativa, and three different human individuals using corresponding nanopore long-read data, and improves the contiguity of each assembly from 1.2-fold up to 304.6-fold (as measured by NGA50 length). Furthermore, LongStitch generates more contiguous and correct assemblies compared to state-of-the-art long-read scaffolder LRScaf in most tests, and consistently improves upon human assemblies in under five hours using less than 23 GB of RAM. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Due to its effectiveness and efficiency in improving draft assemblies using long reads, we expect LongStitch to benefit a wide variety of de novo genome assembly projects.

  abstract = {The neutral theory of molecular evolution predicts that the amount of neutral polymorphisms within a species will increase proportionally with the census population size (Nc). However, this prediction has not been borne out in practice: while the range of Nc spans many orders of magnitude, levels of genetic diversity within species fall in a comparatively narrow range. Although theoretical arguments have invoked the increased efficacy of natural selection in larger populations to explain this discrepancy, few direct empirical tests of this hypothesis have been conducted. In this work, we provide a direct test of this hypothesis using population genomic data from a wide range of taxonomically diverse species. To do this, we relied on the fact that the impact of natural selection on linked neutral diversity depends on the local recombinational environment. In regions of relatively low recombination, selected variants affect more neutral sites through linkage, and the resulting correlation between recombination and polymorphism allows a quantitative assessment of the magnitude of the impact of selection on linked neutral diversity. By comparing whole genome polymorphism data and genetic maps using a coalescent modeling framework, we estimate the degree to which natural selection reduces linked neutral diversity for 40 species of obligately sexual eukaryotes. We then show that the magnitude of the impact of natural selection is positively correlated with Nc, based on body size and species range as proxies for census population size. These results demonstrate that natural selection removes more variation at linked neutral sites in species with large Nc than those with small Nc and provides direct empirical evidence that natural selection constrains levels of neutral genetic diversity across many species. This implies that natural selection may provide an explanation for this longstanding paradox of population genetics.},

We apply our method to nine empirically parametrized eco-evolutionary models of exploiter-victim systems from the literature and identify which particular feedbacks cause some systems to converge to a steady state or to exhibit sustained oscillations. We find that ecological feedbacks involving the interactions between all species and evolutionary and eco-evolutionary feedbacks involving only the interactions between exploiter species (predators or pathogens) are typically stabilizing. In contrast, evolutionary and eco-evolutionary feedbacks involving the interactions between victim species (prey or hosts) are destabilizing more often than not. We also find that while eco-evolutionary feedbacks rarely altered system stability from what would be predicted from just ecological and evolutionary feedbacks, eco-evolutionary feedbacks have the potential to alter system stability at faster or slower speeds of evolution. As the number of empirical studies demonstrating eco-evolutionary feedbacks increases, we can continue to apply these methods to determine whether the patterns we observe are common in other empirical communities.},

  abstract = {The niche expansion and niche variation hypotheses predict that release from interspecific competition will promote niche expansion in depauperate assemblages. Niche expansion can occur by different mechanisms, including an increase in within-individual, among-individual, or bimodal variation (sexual dimorphism). Here we explore whether populations with larger niche breadth have a higher degree of diet variation. We also test whether populations from depauperate lizard assemblages differ in dietary resource use with respect to variation within and/or among individuals and sexual dimorphism. We found support for the niche expansion and niche variation hypotheses. Populations in assemblages with low phylogenetic diversity had a higher degree of individual variation, suggesting a tendency for niche expansion. We also found evidence suggesting that the mechanism causing niche expansion is an increase in variation among individuals rather than an increase in within-individual variation or an increase in bimodal variation due to sexual dimorphism.},

For example, two facultative bacterial symbionts of the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), Serratia symbiotica and Hamiltonella defensa, protect their hosts from parasitism by two species of parasitoid wasp. Previous studies have not explored whether facultative symbionts also play a defensive role against predation in this system. We tested whether feeding on aphids harboring different facultative symbionts affected the fitness of an aphid predator, the lady beetle Hippodamia convergens. While these aphid faculative symbionts did not deter lady beetle feeding, they did decrease survival of lady beetle larvae. Lady beetle larvae fed a diet of aphids with facultative symbionts had significantly reduced survival from egg hatching to pupation and therefore had reduced survival to adult emergence. Additionally, lady beetle adults fed aphids with facultative symbionts were significantly heavier than those fed facultative symbiont-free aphids, though development time was not significantly different. Aphids reproduce clonally and are often found in large groups. Thus, aphid symbionts, by reducing the fitness of the aphid predator H. convergens, may indirectly defend their hosts' clonal descendants against predation. These findings highlight the often far-reaching effects that symbionts can have in ecological systems.},

Although most values were in proportion to the respective metabolic rates, the relatively high protein consumption of the shrew and alligator increased the urine volume and the water requirement over that predicted from metabolic rate alone. 4. Since the oxidative energy available to the alligator is very small, the amount needed for the electrolyte pumps and for protein turnover must be much less than the commonly accepted values.},

  abstract = {In this paper I provide a general framework for linking ecology and evolution. I start from the fact that individuals require energy, trace molecules, water, and mates to survive and reproduce, and that phenotypic resource accrual traits determine an individual's ability to detect and acquire these resources. Optimum traits, and their values, are determined by the dynamics of resources, aspects of the environment that hinder resource detection and acquisition by imposing risks of mortality and reproductive failure, and the energetic costs of developing and maintaining the traits \textendash{} part of an individual's energy budget. These budgets also describe how individuals utilize energy by partitioning it into maintenance, development and/or reproduction at each age and size, age and size at sexual maturity, and the size and number of offspring produced at each reproductive event. The optimum energy budget and body size is consequently determined by the optimum life history strategy that maximizes fitness by trading off size- and age-specific mortality and development rates with any reproductive gains due to extending development and delaying the onset of reproduction. An eco-evolutionary feedback loop occurs when resource accrual traits evolve impacting the quality and quantity of resources that individuals accrue, leading to a new optimum body size and life history strategy and altered population dynamics that, in turn, impact the resource base. These feedback loops can be complex, but can be studied by examining the eco-evolutionary journey of communities from one equilibrium state to another following a perturbation to the environment.},

  abstract = {Climate is changing, forced out of the range of the past million years by levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases not seen in the Earth's atmosphere for a very, very long time. Lacking action by the world's nations, it is clear that the planet will be warmer, sea level will rise, and patterns of rainfall will change. But the future is also partly uncertain -- there is considerable uncertainty about how we will arrive at that different climate. Will the changes be gradual, allowing natural systems and societal infrastructure to adjust in a timely fashion? Or will some of the changes be more abrupt, crossing some threshold or "tipping point" to change so fast that the time between when a problem is recognized and when action is required shrinks to the point where orderly adaptation is not possible? Abrupt Impacts of Climate Change is an updated look at the issue of abrupt climate change and its potential impacts. This study differs from previous treatments of abrupt changes by focusing on abrupt climate changes and also abrupt climate impacts that have the potential to severely affect the physical climate system, natural systems, or human systems, often affecting multiple interconnected areas of concern. The primary timescale of concern is years to decades. A key characteristic of these changes is that they can come faster than expected, planned, or budgeted for, forcing more reactive, rather than proactive, modes of behavior. Abrupt Impacts of Climate Change summarizes the state of our knowledge about potential abrupt changes and abrupt climate impacts and categorizes changes that are already occurring, have a high probability of occurrence, or are unlikely to occur. Because of the substantial risks to society and nature posed by abrupt changes, this report recommends the development of an Abrupt Change Early Warning System that would allow for the prediction and possible mitigation of such changes before their societal impacts are severe. Identifying key vulnerabilities can help guide efforts to increase resiliency and avoid large damages from abrupt change in the climate system, or in abrupt impacts of gradual changes in the climate system, and facilitate more informed decisions on the proper balance between mitigation and adaptation. Although there is still much to learn about abrupt climate change and abrupt climate impacts, to willfully ignore the threat of abrupt change could lead to more costs, loss of life, suffering, and environmental degradation. Abrupt Impacts of Climate Change makes the case that the time is here to be serious about the threat of tipping points so as to better anticipate and prepare ourselves for the inevitable surprises.},

This study examines plasma concentrations of estradiol-17? (E2), testosterone (T), triiodothyronine (T3), and thyroxine (T4) in juvenile alligators (60\textendash 140 cm total length) from two contaminated lakes and one reference lake in Florida. First, the data were analyzed by comparing hormone concentrations among males and females from the different lakes. Whereas there were no differences in plasma E2 concentrations among animals of the three lakes, male alligators from the contaminated lakes (Lake Apopka and Lake Okeechobee) had significantly lower plasma T concentrations compared to males from the reference lake (Lake Woodruff). Concentrations of thyroid hormones also differed in animals of the three lakes, with T4 concentrations being elevated in Lake Okeechobee males compared to Lake Woodruff males. Second, the relationship between body size and hormone concentration was examined using regression analysis. Most notably for steroid hormones, no clear relationship was detected between E and total length in Apopka females (r2 ? 0.09, 2 p ? 0.54) or between T and total length in Apopka males (r2 ? 0.007, p ? 0.75). Females from Apopka (r2 ? 0.318, p ? 0.09) and Okeechobee (r2 ? 0.222, p ? 0.09) exhibited weak correlations between T and total length. Males from Apopka (r2 ? 0.015, 3 p ? 0.66) and Okeechobee (r2 ? 0.128, p ? 0.19) showed no correlation between T and total length. These results indicate: some 4 of the previously reported abnormalities in steroid hormones of hatchling alligators persist, at least, through the juvenile years; steroid and thyroid hormones are related to body size in juvenile alligators from the reference lake, whereas alligators living in lakes Apopka and Okeechobee experience alterations in circulating thyroid and steroid hormones in relationship to body size; and a number of the hormone abnormalities reported previously for Lake Apopka alligators are observed in alligators from Lake Okeechobee\textemdash a lake associated with numerous contaminant sources but no major chemical spill. The endocrine alterations reported in this study are hypothesized to be a response to embryonic exposure to endocrine-disrupting contaminants.},

  abstract = {A phylogeny of the Chironomidae subfamily Podonominae, significant in the history of phylogenetic biogeography, is estimated from an analysis of four genes. Fragments of two ribosomal genes (18S and 28S ), one nuclear protein-coding gene (CAD), and one mitochondrial protein-coding gene (COI ) were sequenced from specimens representing 13 of 15 genera, and analysed using mixed model Bayesian and maximum likelihood inference methods. Podonominae is monophyletic and sister to Tanypodinae \textendash{} the shared development of the larval ligula is synapomorphic and diagnostic. Tribe Podonomini is monophyletic with the inclusion of Trichotanypus; tribe Boreochlini is a grade. Monophyly is confirmed for the genera Podonomus Philippi, Podonomopsis Brundin, Podochlus Brundin, Archaeochlus Brundin and Austrochlus Cranston, Edward \& Cook: Parochlus Enderlein becomes monophyletic through the inclusion of Zelandochlus Brundin (n.syn.) with its type species, P. latipalpis (Brundin) n.comb. The `mandibulate' Archaeochlus plus Austrochlus is monophyletic with nonmandibulate Afrochlus weakly supported as a member of, or sister to, the African Archaeochlus. Subtending this group is Lasiodiamesa, although it associates in some analyses with the sister group Tanypodinae. Generic relationships coincide with those proposed based on morphology, particularly as understood via all life history stages of some problematic (autapomorphic, adult-based) taxa. Divergence time analysis (beast) allows inference of Mesozoic diversification of higher taxa in Podonominae, of appropriate timing for fragmentation of Gondwana, post-African divergence, to have caused vicariance. Shallower nodes (within genera) imply both younger vicariance involving Antarctica and some recent dispersal, including southern to northern hemisphere movement in the New World. New Zealand taxa test controversial biogeographical relationships and show proximity to southern South America without direct Australian sister taxon pairs: dating implies persistence of midges through the `Oligocene' bottleneck.},

Animals were captured in a variety of habitats including marsh, open water, canals, and ponds. Total thyroid hormones were measured by radioimmunoassay. Four criteria were used to evaluate changes in hormone levels: sex, total length, season, and time of day. Thyroxine (T4) varied over a wide range from 0.5 to 57 ng/mL. Triiodothyronine (T3) levels were below the sensitivity of the assay ({$<$}0.6ng/mL). A distinct seasonal peak in T4 was observed between December and April, peaking in March with highest mean T4 levels observed in the spring. Mean T4 declined significantly from the spring to an intermediate summer mean and declined significantly again in the winter. No T4 differences between the sexes were observed. Mean T4 was highest in juveniles, significantly lower in subadults, and significantly lower still in adults. Highest levels were found between 5 P. M. and midnight. With values up to 57 ng/ml in the spring, alligators exhibit T4 levels among the highest recorded for reptiles.},

Such `mesopredator release'2 has been implicated in the decline and extinction of prey species2-6. Because experimental manipulation of carnivores is logistically, financially and ethically problematic6,7, however, few studies have evaluated how trophic cascades generated by the decline of dominant predators combine with other fragmentation effects to influence species diversity in terrestrial systems. Although the mesopredator release hypothesis has received only limited critical evaluation8 and remains controversial9, it has become the basis for conservation programmes justifying the protection of carnivores6. Here we describe a study that exploits spatial and temporal variation in the distribution and abundance of an apex predator, the coyote, in a landscape fragmented by development. It appears that the decline and disappearance of the coyote, in conjunction with the effects of habitat fragmentation, affect the distribution and abundance of smaller carnivores and the persistence of their avian prey.},

We mapped the bifurcation diagram experimentally and found that the populations became more vulnerable to disturbance closer to the tipping point.

However, the stability of a community may benefit from the differential response of species to environmental variations due to the storage effect. This paper provides a systematic and comprehensive discussion of these two contradicting tendencies, using the metacommunity version of the recently proposed time-average neutral model of biodiversity which incorporates environmental stochasticity and demographic noise and allows for extinction and speciation. We show that the incorporation of demographic noise into the model is essential to its applicability, yielding realistic behavior of the system when fitness variations are relatively weak.

We investigated the transmission patterns of a gamma-proteobacterium informally known as pea aphid Bemisia-like symbiont (PABS), also known as T-type, which is widely but not universally distributed in natural populations of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. The vertical transmission of PABS to asexual and sexual morphs and sexually produced eggs was demonstrated by a diagnostic PCR-based assay, and the maximum estimated failure rate was 2\%. Aphids naturally lacking PABS acquired PABS bacteria administered via the diet, and the infection persisted by vertical transmission for at least three aphid generations. PABS was also detected in two of five aphid honeydew samples tested and in all five siphuncular fluid samples tested but in none of 15 samples of salivary secretions from PABS-positive aphids. However, PABS-negative aphids did not acquire PABS when they were cocultured with PABS-positive aphids; the maximal estimated level of horizontal transmission was 18\%. A deterministic model indicated that the force of infection by a horizontal transmission rate of 3\% is sufficient to maintain a previously described estimate of the prevalence of PABS-positive aphids (37\%), if the vertical transmission rate is 98\%. We concluded that PABS infections in A. pisum can be maintained by high vertical transmission rates and occasional horizontal transmission, possibly via the oral route, in the absence of selection either for or against aphids bearing this bacterium.},

  abstract = {Island biodiversity has long fascinated biologists as it typically presents tractable systems for unpicking the eco-evolutionary processes driving community assembly. In general, two recurring themes are of central theoretical interest. First, immigration, diversification, and extinction typically depend on island geographical properties (e.g., area, isolation, and age). Second, predictable ecological and evolutionary trajectories readily occur after colonization, such as the evolution of adaptive trait syndromes, trends toward specialization, adaptive radiation, and eventual ecological decline. Hypotheses such as the taxon cycle draw on several of these themes to posit particular constraints on colonization and subsequent eco-evolutionary dynamics. However, it has been challenging to examine these integrated dynamics with traditional methods. Here, we combine phylogenomics, population genomics and phenomics, to unravel community assembly dynamics among Pheidole (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) ants in the isolated Fijian archipelago. We uphold basic island biogeographic predictions that isolated islands accumulate diversity primarily through in situ evolution rather than dispersal, and population genomic support for taxon cycle predictions that endemic species have decreased dispersal ability and demography relative to regionally widespread taxa. However, rather than trending toward island syndromes, ecomorphological diversification in Fiji was intense, filling much of the genus-level global morphospace. Furthermore, while most endemic species exhibit demographic decline and reduced dispersal, we show that the archipelago is not an evolutionary dead-end. Rather, several endemic species show signatures of population and range expansion, including a successful colonization to the Cook islands. These results shed light on the processes shaping island biotas and refine our understanding of island biogeographic theory.},

The chironomid imago generally exhibits poor powers of flight and oviposition site selection. It is left to the first instar larva to disperse throughout the system and to select substrates upon which to live. Dispersal is achieved passively by wind induced water currents, larvae exhibiting adaptations for a planktonic existence by way of positive photoaxis and an ability to feed while in the plankton. Later instars also regularly leave the substrate under conditions of environmental deterioration. Planktonic activity also occurs in streams and rivers in the form of drift. In this case, larvae have been demonstrated to have poor powers of returning quickly to the substrate, and can be grouped in the category of "catastrophic drift". Downstream drift is compensated for by upstream rheotaxis of young larvae. This planktonic behavior enables the group to rapidly exploit new environments and to successfully colonize both temporary and intermittent habitats.},

No statistically significant changes occurred in arterial bicarbonate concentration. When OH-/H+ and alpha-imidazole were compared at each temperature, more variability was observed in OH-/H+, which increased from 8.7 to 12.0 as temperature increased from 15 to 35 degrees C. alpha-Imidazole remained essentially constant (0.76 at 15 degrees C and 0.80 at 35 degrees C). Body temperature increase caused marked increases in minute ventilation (VE), oxygen consumption (VO2), and carbon dioxide production (VCO2). The relative changes in these parameters resulted in a decrease in both VE/VO2 and VE/VCO2. The data of the present study are consistent with the concept that poikilotherms regulate their alveolar ventilation with changes in body temperature in order to keep OH-/H+ or alpha-imidazole constant.},

Using a synthetic framework of phenotypic evolution that draws from adaptive dynamics and quantitative genetics approaches, we explore how the number of traits under selection influences convergence stability and evolutionary stability in models for coevolution in multidimensional phenotype spaces. Our results allow us to identify three different effects of trait dimensionality on stability. First are (i) a "combinatorial effect": without epistasis and genetic correlations, a higher number of trait dimensions offers more opportunities for equilibria to be unstable; and (ii) epistatic interactions, that is, fitness interactions between traits, which tend to destabilize evolutionary equilibria; this effect increases with the dimension of phenotype space. These first two effects influence both convergence stability and evolutionary stability, while (iii) genetic correlations (due, e.g., to pleiotropy or linkage disequilibrium) can affect only convergence stability. We illustrate the general prediction that increased dimensionality destabilizes evolutionary equilibria using examples drawn from well-studied classical models of frequency-dependent competition for resources, adaptation to a spatially heterogeneous environment, and antagonistic coevolution. In addition, our analyses show that increased dimensionality can favor diversification, for example, in the form of local adaptation, as well as evolutionary escape.},

  abstract = {Many aquatic organisms rely on passive transport of resting stages for their dispersal. In this review, we provide evidence pointing to the high dispersal capacity of both animals (cladocerans, rotifers and bryozoans) and aquatic macrophytes inhabiting lentic habitats. This evidence includes direct observation of dispersal by vectors such as wind and waterfowl and the rapid colonization of new habitats. Such high dispersal capacity contrasts with the abundant evidence of pronounced genetic differentiation among neighbouring populations in many pond-dwelling organisms. We provide an overview of the potential mechanisms causing a discrepancy between high dispersal rates and reduced levels of gene flow. We argue that founder events combined with rapid local adaptation may Underlie the striking patterns of genetic differentiation for neutral markers in many aquatic organisms. Rapid population growth and local adaptation upon colonization of a new habitat result in the effective monopolization of resources, yielding a Strong priority effect. Once a population is locally adapted, the presence of a large resting propagule bank provides a powerful buffer against newly invading genotypes, so enhancing priority effects. Under this Monopolization Hypothesis, high genetic differentiation among nearby populations largely reflects founder events. Phylogeographic data support a scenario of low effective dispersal among populations and persistent effects of historical colonization in cyclical parthenogens. A comparison of patterns of gene flow in taxa with different life cycles suggests an important role of local adaptation in reducing gene flow among populations. We argue that patterns of regional genetic differentiation may often reflect historical colonization of new habitats rather than contemporary gene flow. \textcopyright{} 2002 \'Editions scientifiques et m\'edicales Elsevier SAS.

Autopsy at the end of the experiments revealed that up to 30\% of the thyroidectomized animals had regenerated thyroid follicles (thyroids had few but enlarged follicles). Therefore, we segregated thyroidectomized turtles a posteriori into two groups: those with observable thyroid tissue at autopsy, greater than 3 ng/ml plasma thyroxine (T4), and normal plasma T4 binding capacity were designated partial Tx (PTx), and others with no observable thyroid tissue, less than 3 ng/ml plasma T4, and low plasma T4 binding capacity were designated Tx. Growth rate was significantly reduced 6-8 weeks after thyroidectomy in the Tx animals; length-specific growth rate was affected sooner than mass-specific growth rate. Growth of Tx animals continued to diverge from sham turtles through the end of the experiment; PTx animals did not differ from shams at any time. In a second experiment growth rate was reduced in Tx turtles maintained under both variable (14L:10D, thermal gradient of 19 to 40-degrees-C) and constant (constant light and temperature-30-degrees-C) environmental conditions (i.e., reduced growth rate was probably not related to a thermoregulatory dysfunction). However, all animals maintained under the constant conditions stopped growing after 3 months, whereas turtles kept under variable conditions continued to grow to the end of the experiment (4.5 months). Thyroxine (T4) replacement therapy of long-term Tx turtles restored growth after 6 weeks.  Plasma thyrotropin (TSH) was greatly elevated in Tx turtles (301 +/- 48.7 ng/ml) and at low to nondetectable levels in controls (less-than-or-equal-to 1 ng/ml). T4 replacement therapy was effective in reducing TSH levels in Tx turtles. Plasma T4 and TSH concentrations showed the expected inverse relationship. However, although PTx animals had elevated plasma T4 levels that were in the lower range of the sham controls (PTx: 36.6 +/- 8.2 vs. 112.7 +/- 17.1 ng/ml in sham), their plasma TSH was also significantly elevated (36.5 +/- 9.3 ng/ml vs. 0.8 +/- 0.2 ng/ml in sham). These results demonstrate the requirement of an intact thyroid gland for normal growth of turtles, and provide the first direct evidence for a role for the thyroid in body growth of a reptile. They also reveal that the set-point for the feedback between the thyroid and pituitary secretion can be altered by perturbation of thyroid activity.},

  abstract = {Background: Within-host microbial communities and interactions among microbes are increasingly recognized as important factors influencing host health and pathogen transmission. The microbial community associated with a host is indeed influenced by a complex network of direct and indirect interactions between the host and the lineages of microbes it harbors, but the mechanisms are rarely established. We investigated the within-host interactions among strains of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, using experimental infections in mice. We used a fully crossed-design with three distinct strains, each group of hosts receiving two sequential inoculations. We used data from these experimental infections to assess the effect of coinfection on bacterial dissemination and fitness (by measuring the transmission of bacteria to xenodiagnostic ticks) as well as the effect of coinfection on host immune response compared to single infection. Results: The infection and transmission data strongly indicate a competitive interaction among B. burgdorferi strains within a host in which the order of appearance of the strain is the main determinant of the competitive outcome. This pattern is well described by the classic priority effect in the ecological literature. In all cases, the primary strain a mouse was infected with had an absolute fitness advantage primarily since it was transmitted an order of magnitude more than the secondary strain. The mechanism of exclusion of the secondary strain is an inhibition of the colonization of mouse tissues, even though 29\% of mice showed some evidence of infection by secondary strain. Contrary to expectation, the strong and specific adaptive immune response evoked against the primary strain was not followed by production of immunoglobulins after the inoculation of the secondary strain, neither against strain-specific antigen nor against antigens common to all strains. Hence, the data do not support a major role of the immune response in the observed priority effect. Conclusion: The strong inhibitory priority effect is a dominant mechanism underlying competition for transmission between coinfecting B. burgdorferi strains, most likely through resource exploitation. The observed priority effect could shape bacterial diversity in nature, with consequences in epidemiology and evolution of the disease.},

We present a novel framework that combines basic Mendelian genetics with the powerful demographic approach of matrix population models. The ecological components of the model may be stage classified or age classified, linear or nonlinear, time invariant or time varying, and deterministic or stochastic. Genotypes may affect, in fully pleiotropic fashion, any mixture of demographic traits (viability, fertility, development) at any points in the life cycle. The dynamics of the stage X genotype structure of the population are given by a nonlinear population projection matrix. We show how to construct this matrix and use it to derive sufficient conditions for a protected genetic polymorphism for the case of linear, time-independent demography. These conditions demonstrate that genotype-specific population growth rates ({$\lambda$}) do not determine the outcome of selection. Except in restrictive special cases, heterozygote superiority in {$\lambda$} is neither necessary nor sufficient for a genetic polymorphism. As a consequence, the population growth rate does not always increase, and populations can be driven to extinction due to evolutionary suicide. We demonstrate the construction and analysis of the model using data on a color polymorphism in the common buzzard (Buteo buteo). The model exhibits a stable genetic polymorphism and declining growth rate, consistent with field data and previous models.},

Using single-molecule sequencing, we de novo assembled the genome of the nectarcolonizing yeast, Metschnikowia reukaufii, across eight scaffolds and complete mitochondrion, with gap-free coverage over gene spaces. We found a high rate of tandem gene duplication in this genome, enriched for nitrogen metabolism and transport. Both high-capacity amino acid importers, GAP1 and PUT4, present as tandem gene arrays, were highly expressed in synthetic nectar and regulated by the availability and quality of amino acids. In experiments with competitive nectar yeast, Candida rancensis, amino acid addition alleviated suppression of C. rancensis by early arrival of M. reukaufii, corroborating that amino acid scavenging may contribute to priority effects. Because niche pre-emption via rapid resource depletion may underlie priority effects in a broad range of microbial, plant and animal communities, nutrient scavenging genes like the ones we considered here may be broadly relevant to understanding priority effects.},

Intraspecific genetic variation showed no detectable relationship with geographic distance, but could be grouped into three distinct lineages that correlated with metabolic ability and interspecific competitiveness. Despite ample evidence for strong competitive interactions within and among nectar yeasts, a full spectrum of the genotypic and phenotypic diversity observed across the 200-km coastline was represented even at a scale as small as 200 m. Further, more competitive strains were not necessarily more abundant. These results suggest that dispersal limitation and environmental sorting might not fully explain intraspecific diversity in this microbe and highlight the need to also consider other ecological factors such as trade-offs, source-sink dynamics and niche modification.},

The derivation explicitly accounts for the stochastic components of evolutionary change and is based on ecological processes at the level of the individual. We show that the coevolutionary dynamic can be envisaged as a directed random walk in the community's trait space. A quantitative description of this stochastic process in terms of a master equation is derived. By determining the first jump moment of this process we abstract the dynamic of the mean evolutionary path. To first order the resulting equation coincides with a dynamic that has frequently been assumed in evolutionary game theory. Apart from recovering this canonical equation we systematically establish the underlying assumptions. We provide higher order corrections and show that these can give rise to new, unexpected evolutionary effects including shifting evolutionary isoclines and evolutionary slowing down of mean paths as they approach evolutionary equilibria. Extensions of the derivation to more general ecological settings are discussed. In particular we allow for multi-trait coevolution and analyze coevolution under nonequilibrium population dynamics.},

  abstract = {Pea aphids have several alternative responses to the detection of alarm pheromone produced by conspecifics. One of these, dropping from the feeding site to the ground, is potentially costly owing to the risk of desiccation-induced mortality on the ground before another host plant can be reached. Both dropping and walking from the feeding site incur a cost due to lost feeding opportunity. The aphids' decision as to which anti-predator tactic to use should be sensitive to the costs of their behaviour. Consequently, aphids should be less likely to drop when the risk of desiccation is higher, and less likely to drop or walk when the lost opportunity cost is higher. We tested these predictions by manipulating climatic severity (temperature and humidity) and host quality, respectively. As predicted, aphids are less likely to drop or walk in response to pheromone when feeding on high quality than on low quality hosts, and less likely to drop when the environment is hot and dry than when it is more benign. The latter is true whether the aphids are feeding on real or simulated leaves. Since all aphids were of the same clone, these results show that individual aphid genotypes possess the ability to adaptively modify their escape behaviour with changes in prevailing conditions. A number of other behavioural observations in the aphid literature may be interpreted in an economic or cost-benefit framework. The approach holds considerable promise for understanding many aspects of the anti-predator behaviour of aphids and other animals.},

In an attempt to improve nest survival estimation procedures, we introduce the nest survival model now available in the program MARK and demonstrate its use on a nesting study of Mountain Plovers (Charadrius montanus Townsend) in Montana, USA.

The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma is the main theoretical tool to study cooperation, but this model ignores ecological differences between partners and assumes that amounts exchanged cannot themselves evolve. A more realistic model incorporating these features shows that strategies that succeed with fixed exchanges (e.g., Tit-for-Tat) cannot explain mutualism when exchanges vary because the amount exchanged evolves to 0. For mutualism to evolve, increased investments in a partner must yield in- creased returns, and spatial structure in competitive interac- tions is required. Under these biologically plausible assump- tions, mutualism evolves with surprising ease. This suggests that, contrary to the basic premise of past theoretical analyses, overcoming a potential host's initial defenses may be a bigger obstacle for mutualism than the subsequent recurrence and spread of noncooperative mutants.},

It is known that frequency-dependent selection, generating advantages for rare types, can maintain genetic variation and lead to speciation, but in models with simple phenotypes (that is, low-dimensional phenotype spaces), frequency dependence needs to be strong to generate diversity. However, we show that if the ecological properties of an organism are determined by multiple traits with complex interactions, the conditions needed for frequency-dependent selection to generate diversity are relaxed to the point where they are easily satisfied in high-dimensional phenotype spaces. Mathematically, this phenomenon is reflected in properties of eigenvalues of quadratic forms. Because all living organisms have at least hundreds of phenotypes, this casts the potential importance of frequency dependence for the origin and maintenance of diversity in a new light.},

Burmese pythons, giant constricting snakes native to Asia, now are found throughout much of southern Florida, including all of Everglades National Park (ENP). Pythons have increased dramatically in both abundance and geographic range since 2000 and consume a wide variety of mammals and birds. Here we report severe apparent declines in mammal populations that coincide temporally and spatially with the proliferation of pythons in ENP. Before 2000, mammals were encountered frequently during nocturnal road surveys within ENP. In contrast, road surveys totaling 56,971 km from 2003-2011 documented a 99.3\% decrease in the frequency of raccoon observations, decreases of 98.9\% and 87.5\% for opossum and bobcat observations, respectively, and failed to detect rabbits. Road surveys also revealed that these species are more common in areas where pythons have been discovered only recently and are most abundant outside the python's current introduced range. These findings suggest that predation by pythons has resulted in dramatic declines in mammals within ENP and that introduced apex predators, such as giant constrictors, can exert significant top-down pressure on prey populations. Severe declines in easily observed and/or common mammals, such as raccoons and bobcats, bode poorly for species of conservation concern, which often are more difficult to sample and occur at lower densities.},

Varanus bengalensis is terrestrial and maintains high diurnal body temperatures but, by retreating to cool refugia, lowers body temperature overnight. Varanus salvator is predominantly aquatic and maintains a body temperature of about 30 C by day and night. The water fluxes and metabolic rates of both species are substantially higher than in varanids from semiarid and arid habitats, and are higher than predicted for other tropical reptiles. Approximately 60\% of water influx is derived from drinking and pulmocutaneous exchange in both species.},

  abstract = {Physiological responses to changes in energy balance are tightly regulated by the endocrine system through glucocorticoids, IGF-I and thyroid hormones. Changes in these hormones were studied in eight captive female Steller sea lions that experienced changes in food intake, body mass, body composition, and blood metabolites during summer and winter. During a period of energy restriction, one group of sea lions was fed reduced amounts of Pacific herring and another was fed an isocaloric diet of walleye pollock, after which both groups returned to their pre-experimental diets of herring. Cortisol was negatively and IGF-I was positively associated with changes in body mass during periods of energy restriction (mass loss associated with increase in cortisol and decrease in IGF-I) and refeeding (body mass maintenance associated with stable hormone concentrations in summer and compensatory growth linked to decrease in cortisol and increase in IGF-I in winter). Cortisol and IGF-I were also correlated with changes in lipid and lean mass, respectively. Consequently, these two hormones likely make adequate biomarkers for nutritional stress in sea lions, and when combined provide indication of the energetic strategy (lipid vs lean mass catabolism) animals adopt to cope with changes in nutrient intake. Unlike type of diet fed to the sea lions, age of the animals also impacted hormonal responses, with younger animals showing more intense hormonal changes to nutritional stress. Thyroid hormones, however, were not linked to any physiological changes observed in this study.},

Here, we suggest that epidemics can also end because of rapid host evolution. Focusing on a particular host-parasite system, Daphnia dentifera and its parasite Metschnikowia bicuspidata, we show that Daphnia from lakes with recent epidemics were more resistant to infection and had less variance in susceptibility than Daphnia from lakes without recent epidemics. However, our studies revealed little evidence for genetic variation in infectivity or virulence in Metschnikowia. Incorporating the observed genetic variation in host susceptibility into an epidemiological model parameterized for this system reveals that rapid evolution can explain the termination of epidemics on time scales matching what occurs in lake populations. Thus, not only does our study provide rare evidence for parasite-mediated selection in natural populations, it also suggests that rapid evolution has important effects on short-term host-parasite dynamics.},

AT/GC heterozygotes produce more GC- than AT-gametes, thus conferring a population advantage to GC-alleles in high-recombining regions. This apparently unimportant feature of our molecular machinery has major evolutionary consequences. Structurally, GC-biased gene conversion explains the spatial distribution of GC-content in mammalian genomes\textemdash the so-called isochore structure.

Phylogeographic analysis of NADH2 and microsatellite studies suggests that the Dominican population arose from a set of individuals from the central west area of Puerto Rico within their endemic range. The multiple-individual inoculation, together with sperm storage and evidence of multiple paternity indicate genetic variability and suggest the potential for adaptation by natural selection. Estimates of heritability, common garden experiments and broad sense Q(ST)/F-ST ratios, linked to replicated comparisons along elevational transects go some way to suggesting that the invasive populations may be adapting by natural selection, in parallel with the endemic anole, in the brief period since their introduction.},

We return to the system that originally inspired the taxon cycle\textemdash Melanesian ants\textemdash and perform novel tests of the hypothesis. We analyze (i) the habitat distributions of Fiji's entire ant fauna (183 species), (ii) ecological shifts associated with the in situ radiation of Fijian Pheidole in a phylogenetic context, and (iii) the ecological structure of a massive exotic ant invasion of the archipelago. Our analyses indicate lineages shift toward primary habitats, higher elevation, rarity, and ecological specialization with increasing level of endemism, consistent with taxon cycle predictions. The marginal habitats that historically formed a dispersal conduit in the Pacific are now mostly replaced by human-modified habitats dominated by a colonization pulse of exotic species. We propose this may represent the first phase of an incipient global cycle of human-mediated colonization, ecological shifts, and diversification.},

  abstract = {Coevolutionary interactions are thought to have spurred the evolution of key innovations and driven the diversification of much of life on Earth. However, the genetic and evolutionary basis of the innovations that facilitate such interactions remains poorly understood. We examined the coevolutionary interactions between plants (Brassicales) and butterflies (Pieridae), and uncovered evidence for an escalating evolutionary arms-race. Although gradual changes in trait complexity appear to have been facilitated by allelic turnover, key innovations are associated with gene and genome duplications. Furthermore, we show that the origins of both chemical defenses and of molecular counter adaptations were associated with shifts in diversification rates during the arms-race. These findings provide an important connection between the origins of biodiversity, coevolution, and the role of gene and genome duplications as a substrate for novel traits.},

  abstract = {Biological diversity depends on the interplay between evolutionary diversification and ecological mechanisms allowing species to coexist. Current research increasingly integrates ecology and evolution over a range of timescales, but our common conceptual framework for understanding species coexistence requires better incorporation of evolutionary processes. Here, we focus on the idea of evolutionarily stable communities (ESCs), which are theoretical endpoints of evolution in a community context. We use ESCs as a unifying framework to highlight some important but under-appreciated theoretical results, and we review empirical research relevant to these theoretical predictions. We explain how, in addition to generating diversity, evolution can also limit diversity by reducing the effectiveness of coexistence mechanisms. The coevolving traits of competing species may either diverge or converge, depending on whether the number of species in the community is low (undersaturated) or high (oversaturated) relative to the ESC. Competition in oversaturated communities can lead to extinction or neutrally coexisting, ecologically equivalent species. It is critical to consider trait evolution when investigating fundamental ecological questions like the strength of different coexistence mechanisms, the feasibility of ecologically equivalent species, and the interpretation of different patterns of trait dispersion.},

  abstract = {The information-processing hypothesis (IPH) posits that specialist herbivores should make host-associated decisions more effectively than generalists and thus enjoy associated fitness advantages that may help explain the evolutionary prevalence of host-specific insects. This is because generalists must evaluate a greater diversity of host plants/cues than specialists and thus face a cognitive challenge that is predicted to constrain the efficiency and accuracy of their choices. Here, we present the first individual-level evaluation of this hypothesis. This involved experimentally quantifying the specificity, efficiency, and accuracy of host selection, as both larvae and adults, for many individuals representing each of three `host forms' of Neochlamisus bebbianae leaf beetles. These experiments provided several significant findings: host forms differed in larval specificity, with the more specialized host forms more efficiently and accurately selecting optimal hosts as both larvae and adults. Positive correlations between larval specificity and both efficiency and accuracy across test individuals provided the most direct evidence to date for a biological association between these variables. Our results thus provide strong and consistent support for the IPH at the level of both populations and individuals. Because individual N. bebbianae make many host-associated decisions in nature, our results suggest that cognitive constraints may play a major role in the evolutionary dynamics of ongoing ecological specialization and diversification in this species.},

  abstract = {Specialized interactions help structure communities, but persistence of specialized organisms is puzzling because a generalist can occupy more environments and partake in more beneficial interactions. The ``Jack-of-all-trades is a master of none'' hypothesis asserts that specialists persist because the fitness of a generalist utilizing a particular habitat is lower than that of a specialist adapted to that habitat. Yet, there are many reasons to expect that mutualists will generalize on partners. Plant-soil feedbacks help to structure plant and microbial communities, but how frequently are soil-based symbiotic mutualistic interactions sufficiently specialized to influence species distributions and community composition? To address this question, we quantified realized partner richness and phylogenetic breadth of four wild-grown native legumes (Lupinus bicolor, L. arboreus, Acmispon strigosus and A. heermannii) and performed inoculation trials to test the ability of two hosts (L. bicolor and A. strigosus) to nodulate (fundamental partner richness), benefit from (response specificity), and provide benefit to (effect specificity) 31 Bradyrhizobium genotypes. In the wild, each Lupinus species hosted a broader genetic range of Bradyrhizobium than did either Acmispon species, suggesting that Acmispon species are more specialized. In the greenhouse, however, L. bicolor and A. strigosus did not differ in fundamental association specificity: all inoculated genotypes nodulated both hosts. Nevertheless, A. strigosus exhibited more specificity, i.e., greater variation in its response to, and effect on, Bradyrhizobium genotypes. Lupinus bicolor benefited from a broader range of genotypes but averaged less benefit from each. Both hosts obtained more fitness benefit from symbionts isolated from conspecific hosts; those symbionts in turn gained greater fitness benefit from hosts of the same species from which they were isolated. This study affirmed two important tenets of evolutionary theory. First, as predicted by the Jack-of-all-trades is a master of none hypothesis, specialist A. strigosus obtained greater benefit from its beneficial symbionts than did generalist L. bicolor. Second, as predicted by coevolutionary theory, each test species performed better with partner genotypes isolated from conspecifics. Finally, positive fitness feedback between the tested hosts and symbionts suggests that positive plant-soil feedback could contribute to their patchy distributions in this system.},

Rapidly accumulating evidence from many species of both animal and plant invaders suggests that invasive species often increase pool sizes, particularly of biomass, and promote accelerated flux rates, but many exceptions can be found. Ecosystem dynamics are altered through a variety of interacting, mutually reinforcing mechanistic pathways, including species' resource acquisition traits; population densities; ability to engineer changes to physical environmental conditions; effects on disturbance, especially fire; regimes; the ability to structure habitat for other species; and their impact on food webs. Local factors of landscape setting, history, and other sources of disturbance constrain ecosystem responses to invasions. New research directions are suggested, including the need for whole-system budgets, the quantification of abundance-impact relationships for particular ecosystem processes, and a better exploration of food web impacts on ecosystem processes.},

  abstract = {Trade-offs between functional traits are ubiquitous in nature and can promote species coexistence depending on their shape. Classic theory predicts that convex trade-offs facilitate coexistence of specialized species with extreme trait values (extreme species) while concave trade-offs promote species with intermediate trait values (intermediate species). We show here that this prediction becomes insufficient when the traits translate non-linearly into fitness which frequently occurs in nature, e.g., an increasing length of spines reduces grazing losses only up to a certain threshold resulting in a saturating or sigmoid trait-fitness function. We present a novel, general approach to evaluate the effect of different trade-off shapes on species coexistence. We compare the trade-off curve to the invasion boundary of an intermediate species invading the two extreme species. At this boundary, the invasion fitness is zero. Thus, it separates trait combinations where invasion is or is not possible. The invasion boundary is calculated based on measurable trait\textendash fitness relationships. If at least one of these relationships is not linear, the invasion boundary becomes non-linear, implying that convex and concave trade-offs not necessarily lead to different coexistence patterns. Therefore, we suggest a new ecological classification of trade-offs into extreme-favoring and intermediate-favoring which differs from a purely mathematical description of their shape. We apply our approach to a well-established model of an empirical predator\textendash prey system with competing prey types facing a trade-off between edibility and half-saturation constant for nutrient uptake. We show that the survival of the intermediate prey depends on the convexity of the trade-off. Overall, our approach provides a general tool to make a priori predictions on the outcome of competition among species facing a common trade-off in dependence of the shape of the trade-off and the shape of the trait\textendash fitness relationships.},

Furthermore, we also connected Pfam entries to the Sequence Ontology (SO) through mapping of the Pfam type definitions to SO terms. Since Pfam has many community contributors, we recently enabled the linking between authorship of all Pfam entries with the corresponding authors' ORCID identifiers.

  abstract = {P{$>$}Rapid contemporary evolution due to natural selection is common in the wild, but it remains uncertain whether its effects are an essential component of community and ecosystem structure and function. Previously we showed how to partition change in a population, community or ecosystem property into contributions from environmental and trait change, when trait change is entirely caused by evolution (Hairston et al. 2005). However, when substantial non-heritable trait change occurs (e.g. due to phenotypic plasticity or change in population structure) that approach can mis-estimate both contributions. Here, we demonstrate how to disentangle ecological impacts of evolution vs. non-heritable trait change by combining our previous approach with the Price Equation. This yields a three-way partitioning into effects of evolution, non-heritable phenotypic change and environment. We extend the approach to cases where ecological consequences of trait change are mediated through interspecific interactions. We analyse empirical examples involving fish, birds and zooplankton, finding that the proportional contribution of rapid evolution varies widely (even among different ecological properties affected by the same trait), and that rapid evolution can be important when it acts to oppose and mitigate phenotypic effects of environmental change. Paradoxically, rapid evolution may be most important when it is least evident.},

Questions about potential impacts of transgene flow into wild and weedy populations brought renewed attention to the introgression of crop alleles into those populations. In the past two decades, the field has advanced with considerable descriptive, experimental, and theoretical activity on the dynamics of crop gene introgression and its consequences. As illustrated by five case studies employing an array of different approaches, introgression of crop alleles has occurred for a wide array of species, sometimes without significant consequence, but on occasion leading to the evolution of increased weediness. A new theoretical context has emerged for analyzing empirical data, identifying factors that influence introgression, and predicting introgression's progress. With emerging molecular techniques and analyses, research on crop allele introgression into wild and weedy populations is positioned to make contributions to both transgene risk assessment and reticulate evolution.},

Alligators were maintained at these densities for 3.5 months. At approximately 4 week intervals the alligators were weighed, measured, and bled via cardiac puncture. Duplicate aliquots of plasma were assayed for corticosterone. All of the alligators continued to grow during the experiment, but alligators maintained at the lowest stocking density were significantly heavier and grew significantly faster (P {$<$} 0.01) and had significantly lower plasma corticosterone (P {$<$} 0.01) than alligators maintained at the highest stocking density. These results indicate that crowding (i.e., high-density rearing) of juvenile alligators inhibits maximum growth and that the subsequent stress associated with this crowding results in chronically elevated plasma corticosterone. Plasma corticosterone showed a strong negative correlation with change in body weight; the faster the rate of growth, the lower the hormone levels. These results also show that a single blood sample taken at monthly intervals is sufficient to monitor chronically elevated plasma corticosterone in this species.},

Ecosystem respiration is a critical component of the carbon cycle1,5\textendash 7 and might be important in regulating biosphere response to global climate change1\textendash 3. Here we derive a general model of ecosystem respiration based on the kinetics of meta- bolic reactions11\textendash 13 and the scaling of resource use by individual organisms14,15. The model predicts that fluxes of CO2 and energy are invariant of ecosystem biomass, but are strongly influenced by temperature, variation in cellular metabolism and rates of supply of limiting resources (water and/or nutrients). Variation in ecosystem respiration within sites, as calculated from a net- work of CO2 flux towers5,7, provides robust support for the model's predictions. However, data indicate that variation in annual flux between sites is not strongly dependent on average site temperature or latitude. This presents an interesting paradox with regard to the expected temperature dependence. Never- theless, our model provides a basis for quantitatively under- standing energy and material flux between the atmosphere and biosphere.},

Selection agents are repetitious through time and they have worked on a basic, though diverse, genetic and phenetic groundplan. This process leads to convergence and parallelism throughout the family in structural features and geographic patterns. Taxa arise in equatorial latitudes and are driven through stages along pathways to extinction in three directions: toward the poles, up mountains, and into the forest canopy. Driving forces are many and varied, including development of more potent adversaries, climatic cycles, tectonic events, and microhabitat changes based on floral evolution, but evolutionary results are of a repetitious nature through time as evidenced by disparate groups of carabids following the same paths over and over. This is certainly not a totally new concept, but rather a new formulation or synthesis of many concepts. The realization that changes occur along ordered pathways and are repeated lineage after lineage in the history of major groups leads to the conclusion that evolution has boundaries in which it operates, and that perhaps there are some rules.},

The dry weight intake of bass fed the tadpole diet for 25 days was similar (x = 1.41 g/ day) to that of bass fed minnows and suckers (x = 1.57 g/day), but those fed tadpoles had a significantly smaller change in condition factor (x = 0.04 and 0.11, respectively). The diets were then reversed (bass previously fed tadpoles were fed minnows and suckers, and vice versa) for 14 days. During this period the daily intake of the group fed minnows and suckers was significantly larger (x = 1.81 g/ day) than that of the group fed tadpoles (x = 0.81 g/ day). The condition factor of bass on the fish diet improved, whereas bass on the tadpole diet lost weight. It is suggested that bullfrog larvae are suboptimum forage items for largemouth bass.},

Integrating evolution into studies of invasions is important, because species traits can potentially evolve in ways that either moderate or exacerbate the impacts of invasions. We have assessed whether species evolved during experimental invasions by comparing the performance of founder populations and their potentially evolved descendants in communities of ciliates and rotifers. Residents (analogous to native species) that have previous experience with invaders consistently reduced the performance of naive invaders, supporting the emergence of increased biotic resistance as one consequence of evolution during invasions. Experienced invaders exhibited both increased and decreased performance depending on the invader species considered. Through its influence on performance and species abundance, evolution also changed community composition during the course of invasions. The idiosyncratic patterns of evolutionary changes in invading and resident species complicate predictions about the long-term consequences of invasions from initial post-invasion dynamics.},

Foundations of Restoration Ecology is an important milestone in the field, bringing together leading ecologists to bridge the gap between theory and practice by translating elements of ecological theory and current research themes into a scientific framework for the field of restoration ecology. Each chapter addresses a particular area of ecological theory, covering traditional levels of biological hierarchy (such as population genetics, demography, community ecology) as well as topics of central relevance to the challenges of restoration ecology (such as species interactions, fine-scale heterogeneity, successional trajectories, invasive species ecology, ecophysiology). Several chapters focus on research tools (research design, statistical analysis, modeling), or place restoration ecology research in a larger context (large-scale ecological phenomena, macroecology, climate change and paleoecology, evolutionary ecology). The book makes a compelling case that a stronger connection between ecological theory and the science of restoration ecology will be mutually beneficial for both fields: restoration ecology benefits from a stronger grounding in basic theory, while ecological theory benefits from the unique opportunities for experimentation in a restoration context. Foundations of Restoration Ecology advances the science behind the practice of restoring ecosystems while exploring ways in which restoration ecology can inform basic ecological questions. It provides the first comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations of restoration ecology, and is a must-have volume for anyone involved in restoration research, teaching, or practice.},

Because the benefits of plant height depend on which other height strategies are present, competition for light can usefully be framed as a game-theoretic problem. The vertical structure of the world's vegetation, which is inefficient for plant growth, can then be understood as the outcome of evolutionary and ecological arms races. In addition, game-theoretic models predict taller vegetation on sites of higher leaf area index, and allocation to reproduction only after an initial period of height growth. However, of 14 game-theoretic models for height reviewed here, only one predicts coexistence of a mix of height strategies, a conspicuous feature of most vegetation. We suggest that game-theoretic models could help account for observed mixtures of height strategies if they incorporated processes for coexistence along spectra of light income and time since disturbance.},

  abstract = {HIV can evolve remarkably quickly in response to antiretroviral therapies and the immune system. This evolution stymies treatment effectiveness and prevents the development of an HIV vaccine. Consequently, there has been a great interest in using population genetics to disentangle the forces that govern the HIV adaptive landscape (selection, drift, mutation, and recombination). Traditional population genetics approaches look at the current state of genetic variation and infer the processes that can generate it. However, because HIV evolves rapidly, we can also sample populations repeatedly over time and watch evolution in action. In this paper, we demonstrate how time series data can bound evolutionary parameters in a way that complements and informs traditional population genetic approaches. Specifically, we focus on our recent paper (Feder et al., 2016, eLife ), in which we show that, as improved HIV drugs have led to fewer patients failing therapy due to resistance evolution, less genetic diversity has been maintained following the fixation of drug resistance mutations. Because soft sweeps of multiple drug resistance mutations spreading simultaneously have been previously documented in response to the less effective HIV therapies used early in the epidemic, we interpret the maintenance of post-sweep diversity in response to poor therapies as further evidence of soft sweeps and therefore a high population mutation rate ( \texttheta{} ) in these intra-patient HIV populations. Because improved drugs resulted in rarer resistance evolution accompanied by lower post-sweep diversity, we suggest that both observations can be explained by decreased population mutation rates and a resultant transition to hard selective sweeps. A recent paper (Harris et al., 2018, PLOS Genetics ) proposed an alternative interpretation: Diversity maintenance following drug resistance evolution in response to poor therapies may have been driven by recombination during slow, hard selective sweeps of single mutations. Then, if better drugs have led to faster hard selective sweeps of resistance, recombination will have less time to rescue diversity during the sweep, recapitulating the decrease in post-sweep diversity as drugs have improved. In this paper, we use time series data to show that drug resistance evolution during ineffective treatment is very fast, providing new evidence that soft sweeps drove early HIV treatment failure.},

Yet, although climate and landscape change are often touted as post-hoc explanations of biological change, our understanding of past climate and landscape change influences on evolutionary processes is severely hindered by the limited application of methods that directly relate environmental change to species dynamics through time. Increased integration of spatiotemporal environmental and genetic data will revolutionize the interpretation of environmental influences on past population processes and the quantification of recent anthropogenic impacts on species, and vastly improve prediction of species responses under future climate change scenarios, yielding widespread revelations across evolutionary biology, landscape ecology and conservation genetics. This review encourages greater use of spatiotemporal landscape genetic analyses that explicitly link landscape, climate and genetic data through time by providing an overview of analytical approaches for integrating historical genetic and environmental data in five key research areas: population genetic structure, demography, phylogeography, metapopulation connectivity and adaptation. We also include a tabular summary of key methodological information, suggest approaches for mitigating the particular difficulties in applying these techniques to ancient DNA and palaeoclimate data, and highlight areas for future methodological development.},

We found significant clonal variation in resistance to all three natural enemies. We tested the hypothesis that there might be trade-offs (negative covariation) in defensive ability against different natural enemies, but found no evidence for this. All correlations in defensive ability were positive, that between the two parasitoid species significantly so. Defensive ability was not correlated with fecundity. A number of aphid clones were completely resistant to one parasitoid (A. eadyi), but a subset of these failed to reproduce subsequently.

Adaptive dynamics theory predicts that successive trait substitutions driven by eco-evolutionary feedbacks can gradually erode population size or growth rate, thus potentially raising the extinction risk. Even a single trait substitution can suffice to degrade population viability drastically at once and cause `evolutionary suicide'. In a changing environment, a population may track a viable evolutionary attractor that leads to evolutionary suicide, a phenomenon called `evolutionary trapping'. Evolutionary trapping and suicide are commonly observed in adaptive dynamics models in which the smooth variation of traits causes catastrophic changes in ecological state. In the face of trapping and suicide, evolutionary rescue requires that the population overcome evolutionary threats generated by the adaptive process itself. Evolutionary repellors play an important role in determining how variation in environmental conditions correlates with the occurrence of evolutionary trapping and suicide, and what evolutionary pathways rescue may follow. In contrast with standard predictions of evolutionary rescue theory, low genetic variation may attenuate the threat of evolutionary suicide and small population sizes may facilitate escape from evolutionary traps.},

  abstract = {Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) returning to streams around the North Pacific Rim provide a nutrient subsidy to these ecosystems. While many species of animals feed directly on salmon carcasses each autumn, salmon-derived nutrients can also be stored in coastal habitats throughout the year. The effects of this storage legacy on vertebrates in other seasons are not well understood, especially in estuaries, which can receive a large portion of post-spawning salmon nutrients. We examine the effects of residual salmon-derived nutrients, forest habitats and landscape features on summer breeding birds in estuary forests. We compared models containing environmental variables and combined chum (Oncorhynchus keta) and pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) salmon biomass to test predictions concerning bird density and diversity. We discovered that total bird, insectivore, golden-crowned kinglet and Pacific wren densities and Shannon's diversity in the summer were strongly predicted by salmon biomass in the autumn. For most metrics, this relationship approaches an asymptote beyond 40 000 kg of salmon biomass. Foliage height diversity, watershed catchment area and estuary area were also important predictors of avian communities. Our study suggests that the legacy of salmon nutrients influences breeding bird density and diversity in estuaries that vary across a wide gradient of spawning salmon biomass.},

Human-associated microbial communities are diverse, and the structure of these communities is variable across body habitats, through time, and between individuals.

Due to methodological limitations and the largely unknown natural history of most microbial taxa, this integration of ecology into research on the human microbiome is still in its infancy. However, such integration will yield a deeper understanding of the role of the microbiome in human health and an improved ability to test ecological concepts that are more difficult to test in plant and animal systems.},

In this study, we explored the, possibility that ecological history can cause differences in community responses to perturbation using parallel acidification experiments in three sites with different PH histories in the Northern Highland Lake District of Wisconsin, USA. In Trout Lake, high acid neutralizing capacity had historically buffered changes in pH. In contrast, the two basins of Little Rock Lake (Little Rock-Reference and Little Rock-Treatment) had experienced seasonal fluctuations in pH. Furthermore, the two lake basins were separated with a curtain and Little Rock-Treatment was experimentally acidified in the late 1980s. In each site, we conducted mesocosm experiments to compare zooplankton community dynamics in control (ambient pH) and acidified (pH 4.7) treatments. Zooplankton community responses were strongest in Trout Lake and weakest in Little Rock-Treatment suggesting that ecological history affected responses to acidification. In part, variation in community sensitivity to acidification was driven by differences in species composition. However, the results of a reciprocal transplant experiment indicated that changes in the acid tolerance of populations during past acidification events may make zooplankton communities less sensitive to subsequent pH stress. Our study highlights the role that ecological history may play in community-level responses to environmental change.},

Inhabitants of the region have discovered, to their surprise, that the fish populations in certain mouth-lakes have diminished following the disappearance of the caimans; even piranhas have decreased in number. Close interdependence exists, or seems to have existed, between caimans and the fish in the limnologically very extreme, central Amazonian water bodies, in the manner outlined below. Those tributaries of the Amazon which do not come from the peripheral regions, but arise in the tertiary central Amazonian plains, are so extremely poor in essential electrolytes that primary production is scarcely possible in them. The food chain is based on organic material which enters the water from the surrounding forests. In addition, swarms of fish originating in the electrolyte- and nutrient-rich waters of the Amazon River and its bordering flood basins migrate into the usually broadened, lake-like lower reaches of these rivers to breed. Many of the fish serve as prey here for the predatory fish, turtles, caimans, and aquatic mammals. Part of this allochthonous food is immediately transformed into nutrients by rapid metabolism. These nutrients support a limited primary production, and serve as the basis for building up a food chain which, in turn, benefits the rising generation of fish. The greater and more differentiated is the biomass in these electrolyte-poor water bodies, the more stable seems to be the biocenosis. For the more numerous and varied are the single components of the biotic communities, the more efficient must be the biological filters for the allochthonous sources of nutrition which they form.},

  abstract = {We discuss a method for analyzing data that are positively skewed and contain a sub- stantial proportion of zeros. Such data commonly arise in ecological applications, when the focus is on the abundance of a species. The form of the distribution is then due to the patchy nature of the environment and/or the inherent heterogeneity of the species. The method can be used whenever we wish to model the data as a response variable in terms of one or more explanatory variables. The analysis consists of three stages. The first involves creating two sets of data from the original: one shows whether or not the species is present; the other indicates the logarithm of the abundance when it is present. These are referred to as the `presence data' and the `log-abundance' data, respectively. The second stage involves modelling the presence data using logistic regression, and separately mod- elling the log-abundance data using ordinary regression. Finally, the third stage involves combining the two models in order to estimate the expected abundance for a specific set of values of the explanatory variables. A common approach to analyzing this sort of data is to use a ln (y+c) transformation, where c is some constant (usually one). The method we use here avoids the need for an arbitrary choice of the value of c, and allows the modelling to be carried out in a natural and straightforward manner, using well-known regression techniques. The approach we put forward is not original, having been used in both con- servation biology and fisheries. Our objectives in this paper are to (a) promote the application of this approach in a wide range of settings and (b) suggest that parametric bootstrapping be used to provide confidence limits for the estimate of expected abundance.},

We examined habitat preference by quantifying the density and settlement date of eight species of migratory pas- serines breeding in areas with and without intact nest predator com- munities. We found consistently more individuals nesting in areas with reduced nest predation than in areas with intact predator as- semblages, although predation risk had no influence on settlement or breeding phenology. Additionally, those individuals occupying safer nesting habitats exhibited increased singing activity.

By combining global positioning system telemetry of an abundant antelope (impala) and its main predators (leopards and wild dogs) with a series of manipulative field experiments, we showed that herbivores' risk-avoidance behavior and plants' antiherbivore defenses interact to determine tree distributions in an African savanna. Well-defended thorny Acacia trees (A. etbaica) were abundant in low-risk areas where impala aggregated but rare in high-risk areas that impala avoided. In contrast, poorly defended trees (A. brevispica) were more abundant in high- than in low-risk areas. Our results suggest that plants can persist in landscapes characterized by intense herbivory, either by defending themselves or by thriving in risky areas where carnivores hunt.},

Here we present a general model that predicts three key factors will be important in mutualism evolution: (i) high benefit to cost ratio, (ii) high within-species relatedness and (iii) high between-species fidelity. These factors operate by moderating three types of feedback benefit from mutualism: cooperator association, partner-fidelity feedback and partner choice. In defining the relationship between these processes, our model also allows an assessment of their relative importance. Importantly, the model suggests that phenotypic feedbacks (partner-fidelity feedback, partner choice) are a more important explanation for between-species cooperation than the development of genetic correlations among species (cooperator association). We explain the relationship of our model to existing theories and discuss the empirical evidence for our predictions.},

Abandonment was the most common cause of nesting failure for all species and usually occurred following heavy rainfall and periods of rising surface water. Using stepwise logistic regression, we found that rapid surface water drying rate was associated most strongly with White Ibis (Eudocimus albus) nesting success, and that amount of rainfall was directly associated with failure of Great Egret (Casmerodius alba) nests. From records of 32 past surveys of White Ibis nesting numbers in two different water management areas, we found that years with high nesting numbers had significantly faster spring drying rates than years with low nesting numbers. There was no significant difference in amount of spring rainfall, autumn/winter drying rate, or water depth. Abandonments by ibises appeared to be closely related to prey densities, which probably were directly affected by water-level fluctuations.},

  abstract = {Venom is a key innovation underlying the evolution of advanced snakes (Caenophidia). Despite this, very little is known about venom system structural diversification, toxin recruitment event timings, or toxin molecular evolution. A multidisciplinary approach was used to examine the diversification of the venom system and associated toxins across the full range of the approximately 100 million-year-old advanced snake clade with a particular emphasis upon families that have not secondarily evolved a front-fanged venom system ( approximately 80\% of the 2500 species). Analysis of cDNA libraries revealed complex venom transcriptomes containing multiple toxin types including three finger toxins, cobra venom factor, cysteine-rich secretory protein, hyaluronidase, kallikrein, kunitz, lectin, matrix metalloprotease, phospholipase A(2), snake venom metalloprotease/a disintegrin and metalloprotease, and waprin. High levels of sequence diversity were observed, including mutations in structural and functional residues, changes in cysteine spacing, and major deletions/truncations. Morphological analysis comprising gross dissection, histology, and magnetic resonance imaging also demonstrated extensive modification of the venom system architecture in non-front-fanged snakes in contrast to the conserved structure of the venom system within the independently evolved front-fanged elapid or viperid snakes. Further, a reduction in the size and complexity of the venom system was observed in species in which constriction has been secondarily evolved as the preferred method of prey capture or dietary preference has switched from live prey to eggs or to slugs/snails. Investigation of the timing of toxin recruitment events across the entire advanced snake radiation indicates that the evolution of advanced venom systems in three front-fanged lineages is associated with recruitment of new toxin types or explosive diversification of existing toxin types. These results support the role of venom as a key evolutionary innovation in the diversification of advanced snakes and identify a potential role for non-front-fanged venom toxins as a rich source for lead compounds for drug design and development.},

  abstract = {The predatory ecology of Varanus komodoensis (Komodo Dragon) has been a subject of long-standing interest and considerable conjecture. Here, we investigate the roles and potential interplay between cranial mechanics, toxic bacteria, and venom. Our analyses point to the presence of a sophisticated combined-arsenal killing apparatus. We find that the lightweight skull is relatively poorly adapted to generate high bite forces but better adapted to resist high pulling loads. We reject the popular notion regarding toxic bacteria utilization. Instead, we demonstrate that the effects of deep wounds inflicted are potentiated through venom with toxic activities including anticoagulation and shock induction. Anatomical comparisons of V. komodoensis with V. (Megalania) priscus fossils suggest that the closely related extinct giant was the largest venomous animal to have ever lived.},

Bioactivity characterization of exendin and helokinestatin elucidated variable cardioactivity between isoforms within each class.

  abstract = {Diversity in biological communities is a historical product of immigration, diversification and extinction, but the combined effect of these processes is poorly understood. Here we show that the order and timing of immigration controls the extent of diversification. When an ancestral bacterial genotype was introduced into a spatially structured habitat, it rapidly diversified into multiple niche-specialist types. However, diversification was suppressed when a niche-specialist type was introduced before, or shortly after, introduction of the ancestral genotype. In contrast, little suppression occurred when the same niche specialist was introduced relatively late. The negative impact of early arriving immigrants was attributable to the historically sensitive outcome of interactions involving neutral competition and indirect facilitation. Ultimately, the entire boom-and-bust dynamics of adaptive radiation were altered. These results demonstrate that immigration and diversification are tightly linked processes, with small differences in immigration history greatly affecting the evolutionary emergence of diversity.},

A total of 14 aphid strains were examined, and the S-symbiont was detected in 4 Japanese strains by diagnostic PCR. Two types of eubacterial 16S ribosomal DNA sequences were identified in disymbiotic strains; one of these types was obtained from the primary symbiont Buchnera sp., and the other was obtained from the S-symbiont. In situ hybridization and electron microscopy revealed that the S-symbiont was localized not only in the sheath cells but also in a novel type of cells, the secondary mycetocytes (S-mycetocytes), which have not been found previously in A. pisum. The size and shape of the S-symbiont cells were different when we compared the symbionts in the sheath cells and the symbionts in the S-mycetocytes, indicating that the S-symbiont is pleomorphic under different endosymbiotic conditions. Light microscopy, electron microscopy, and diagnostic PCR revealed unequivocally that the hemocoel is also a normal location for the S-symbiont. Occasional disordered localization of S-symbionts was also observed in adult aphids, suggesting that there has been imperfect host-symbiont coadaptation over the short history of coevolution of these organisms.},

We examined how extinctions in a heterogeneous landscape of patches affects the influence of environmental, spatial, and stochastic factors on community composition in a simple two-species, two-habitat, protist metacommunity where each species dominates in a different habitat type. We imposed four different levels of random extinctions on local patches and monitored changes in the metacommunity through time. We found that near-steady state patterns of community variability developed relatively rapidly (within nine colonization-extinction cycles) and that increased extinction rate produced altered patterns of community regulation by reducing environmental control and increasing spatial and stochastic effects. Our results indicate a possible explanation for the combination of environmental, spatial and stochastic effects observed in natural metacommunities.},

Today's theoretical ecologists are extending this work to study the eco-evolutionary dynamics of multispecies communities and the functioning and evolutionary emergence of ecosystems. 3. In terms of methodology, eco-evolutionary modelling has diversified from simple, locus-based population genetic models to encompass models of clonal selection, quantitative trait dynamics and adaptive dynamics. 4. The few empirical studies on community dynamics that explicitly considered evolutionary processes support the view that evolutionary and ecological dynamics often occur on similar time-scales, and that they co-determine the dynamical behaviour of ecological communities. \textcopyright{} 2007 The Authors.},

  abstract = {The persistence of ecological communities is challenged by widespread and rapid environmental change. In many cases, persistence may not be assured via physiological acclimation or migration and so species must adapt rapidly in situ. This process of evolutionary rescue (ER) occurs when genetic adaptation allows a population to recover from decline initiated by environmental change that would otherwise cause extirpation. Community evolutionary rescue (CER) occurs when one or more species undergo a rapid evolutionary response to environmental change, resulting in the recovery of the ancestral community. Here, we study the dynamics of CER within a threespecies community coexisting by virtue of resource oscillations brought about by nonlinear interactions between two species competing for a live resource. We allowed gradual environmental change to affect the traits that determine the strength and symmetry of the interaction among species. By allowing the component species to evolve rapidly, we found that: (i) trait evolution can allow CER and ensure the community persists by preventing competitive exclusion during environmental change, (ii) CER brings about a change in the character of the oscillations (period, amplitude) governing coexistence before and after environmental change, and (iii) CER may depend on evolutionary change that occurs simultaneously with or subsequently to environmental change.Wewere able to showthat a change in the character of community oscillations may be a signature that a community is undergoing ER. Our study extends the theory on ER to a world of nonlinear community dynamics where-despite high-frequency changes of population abundances-adaptive evolutionary trait change can be gradual and directional, and therefore contribute to community rescue. ER may happen in real, complex communities that fluctuate owing to a mix of external and internal forces. Experiments testing this theory are now required to validate our predictions. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

Each pipeline trains statistical models of protein-coding genes based on provided evidence and, then predicts protein-coding genes in genomic sequences using both the extrinsic evidence and statistical models. For training and prediction, BRAKER1 and BRAKER2 incorporate complementary extrinsic evidence: BRAKER1 uses only RNA-seq data while BRAKER2 uses only a database of cross-species proteins. The BRAKER suite has so far not been able to reliably exceed the accuracy of BRAKER1 and BRAKER2 when incorporating both types of evidence simultaneously. Currently, for a novel genome project where both RNA-seq and protein data are available, the best option is to run both pipelines independently, and to pick one, likely better output. Therefore, one or another type of the extrinsic evidence would remain unexploited. Results:\hspace{0.6em} We present TSEBRA, a software that selects gene predictions (transcripts) from the sets generated by BRAKER1 and BRAKER2. TSEBRA uses a set of rules to compare scores of overlapping transcripts based on their support by RNA-seq and homologous protein evidence. We show in computational experiments on genomes of 11 species that TSEBRA achieves higher accuracy than either BRAKER1 or BRAKER2 running alone and that TSEBRA compares favorably with the combiner tool EVidenceModeler. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} TSEBRA is an easy-to-use and fast software tool. It can be used in concert with the BRAKER pipeline to generate a gene prediction set supported by both RNAseq and homologous protein evidence.},

In fact, intransitive competition has typically been studied in isolation from other pairwise stabilising processes, and thus little is known about how intransitivity interacts with more traditional drivers of species coexistence such as niche partitioning. To integrate intransitivity into traditional coexistence theory, we developed a metric of growth rate when rare, (Formula presented.), to identify and quantify the impact of intransitive competition against a backdrop of pairwise stabilising niche differences. Using this index with simulations of community dynamics, we demonstrate that intransitive loops can both stabilise or destabilise species coexistence, but the strength and importance of intransitive interactions are significantly affected by the length and the topology of these loops. We conclude by showing how (Formula presented.) can be used to evaluate effects of intransitivity in empirical studies. Our results emphasise the need to integrate complex mechanisms emerging from diverse interactions into our understanding of species coexistence.},

We previously observed that linkage disequilibrium (LD) at scales of {$\sim$}10 kb in the \emph{Drosophila} Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), consisting of 145 inbred strains from Raleigh, North Carolina, measured both between pairs of sites and as haplotype homozygosity, is elevated above neutral demographic expectations. We also demonstrated that signatures of strong and recent soft sweeps are abundant. However, the extent to which these patterns are specific to this derived and admixed population is unknown. It is also unclear whether these patterns are a consequence of the extensive inbreeding performed to generate the DGRP data. Here we analyze LD statistics in a sample of \&gt;100 fully-sequenced strains from Zambia; an ancestral population to the Raleigh population that has experienced little to no admixture and was generated by sequencing haploid embryos rather than inbred strains. We find an elevation in long-range LD and haplotype homozygosity compared to neutral expectations in the Zambian sample, thus showing the elevation in LD is not specific to the DGRP data set. This elevation in LD and haplotype structure remains even after controlling for possible confounders including genomic inversions, admixture, population substructure, close relatedness of individual strains, and recombination rate variation. Furthermore, signatures of partial soft sweeps similar to those found in the DGRP as well as partial hard sweeps are common in Zambia. These results suggest that while the selective forces and sources of adaptive mutations may differ in Zambia and Raleigh, elevated long-range LD and signatures of soft sweeps are generic in \emph{D. melanogaster}.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Unfortunately, the weighted mean has no analytical analog of the standard error of the arithmetic mean for use in characterizing its statistical uncertainty. Several approximate expressions have been used previously in the literature, but there is no consensus as to which is best. This paper compares three methods from the literature with a standard based on bootstrapping. Comparative calculations were carried out for nine major ions measured at 222 sampling sites in the National Atmospheric Deposition/National Trends Network (NADP/NTN). The ratio variance approximation of Cochran (1977) gave results that were not statistically different from those of bootstrapping, and is suggested as the method of choice for routine computing of the standard error of the weighted mean. The bootstrap method has advantages of its own, including the fact that it is nonparametric, but requires additional effort and computation time.},

  abstract = {Reduced prey availability has emerged as a primary hypothesis to explain population constraints on wading birds in numerous wetlands around the world. However, there is almost no understanding of which component of prey availability (i.e., prey density or vulnerability of prey to capture) is affecting populations and whether the relative effects of each component differ among species. In this study, I manipulated prey density and water depth (i.e., prey availability) in 12 0.2-ha ponds to determine their relative effects on the numeric response of eight species of free-ranging wading birds (White Ibis, Eudocimus albus; Wood Stork, Mycteria americana; Snowy Egret, Egretta thula; Glossy Ibis, Plegadis falcinellus; Great Egret, Ardea alba; Tricolored Heron, Egretta tricolor; Great Blue Heron, Ardea herodias; and Little Blue Heron, Egretta caerulea). The experiment was conducted in a constructed wetland adjacent to, and west of, the northern tip of the remnant Everglades, in Palm Beach County, Florida, USA. Each pond was set to a water depth of 10 cm, 19 cm, or 28 cm, and was stocked with golden shiners (Notemigonus crysoleucas) at a density of either 3 fish/m(2) or 10 fish/m(2). Total bird use (all treatments pooled) increased from day 1 (day after stocking) to day 6, stabilized for several days at similar to280 birds, and then decreased until day 16, when bird use nearly ceased. Fish were depleted most rapidly in the shallow treatment and least rapidly in the deep treatment. The giving-up-density (GUD) of prey increased with increasing water depth. There was no significant difference among species in the slope of that relationship; however, a visual inspection of the data showed that differences in GUDs were becoming more apparent in the deepest treatment. At that depth, the White Ibis, Wood Stork, and Snowy Egret had higher GUDs than did the Glossy Ibis, Great Egret, Tricolored Heron, Great Blue Heron, and Little Blue Heron. Also, the first three species were affected significantly by both prey density and water depth, whereas the latter five species showed a decidedly weaker response to one or the other component of prey availability. The first three species were more abundant in the shallow treatments and the high prey density treatments, and they abandoned the study site before other species reached their maximum density. The feeding strategy of the first group appeared to be one of searching for new high-quality food patches rather than staying and exploiting food patches that were declining in quality. Species that employed a searching strategy also have shown the most severe population declines, suggesting that factors affecting bird density at feeding sites may also have affected population size.},

Sequence-based evidence suggests that facultative symbionts such as Hamiltonella defensa or Regiella insecticola also undergo horizontal transmission.

Here, we tested if parasitoids or ectoparasitic mites can act as vectors for horizontal transfer of facultative symbionts. Using symbiont-specific primers for diagnostic PCR, we demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that parasitoids can indeed transfer H. defensa and R. insecticola by sequentially stabbing infected and uninfected individuals of their host, Aphis fabae , establishing new, heritable infections. Thus, a natural route of horizontal symbiont transmission is also available during the many clonal generations of the aphid life cycle. No transmissions by ectoparasitic mites were observed, nor did parasitoids that emerged from symbiont-infected aphids transfer any symbionts in our experiments.},

These results demonstrate the interlinked importance of the genetics of a tree and its microbiome, which can be used to restore forest losses resulting from drought.Plant genetic variation and soil microorganisms are individually known to influence plant responses to climate change, but the interactive effects of these two factors are largely unknown. Using long-term observational studies in the field and common garden and greenhouse experiments of a foundation tree species (Pinus edulis) and its mutualistic ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) associates, we show that EMF community composition is under strong plant genetic control. Seedlings acquire the EMF community of their seed source trees (drought tolerant vs. drought intolerant), even when exposed to inoculum from the alternate tree type. Drought-tolerant trees had 25\% higher growth and a third the mortality of drought-intolerant trees over the course of 10 y of drought in the wild, traits that were also observed in their seedlings in a common garden. Inoculation experiments show that EMF communities are critical to drought tolerance. Drought-tolerant and drought-intolerant seedlings grew similarly when provided sterile EMF inoculum, but drought-tolerant seedlings grew 25\% larger than drought-intolerant seedlings under dry conditions when each seedling type developed its distinct EMF community. This demonstration that particular combinations of plant genotype and mutualistic EMF communities improve the survival and growth of trees with drought is especially important, given the vulnerability of forests around the world to the warming and drying conditions predicted for the future.},

Our analyses of this genome, along with comparisons with other vertebrate genomes, reinforce the uniqueness of the tuatara. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the tuatara lineage diverged from that of snakes and lizards around 250 million years ago. This lineage also shows moderate rates of molecular evolution, with instances of punctuated evolution. Our genome sequence analysis identifies expansions of proteins, non-protein-coding RNA families and repeat elements, the latter of which show an amalgam of reptilian and mammalian features. The sequencing of the tuatara genome provides a valuable resource for deep comparative analyses of tetrapods, as well as for tuatara biology and conservation. Our study also provides important insights into both the technical challenges and the cultural obligations that are associated with genome sequencing.},

The concept of evolutionarily singular strategies is introduced as a generalization of the ESS-concept. We give a full classification of the singular strategies in terms of ESS-stability, convergence stability, the ability of the singular strategy to invade other populations if initially rare itself, and the possibility of protected dimorphisms occurring within the singular strategy's neighbourhood. Of particular interest is a type of singular strategy that is an evolutionary attractor from a great distance, but once in its neighbourhood a population becomes dimorphic and undergoes disruptive selection leading to evolutionary branching. Modelling the adaptive growth and branching of the evolutionary tree can thus be considered as a major application of the framework. A haploid version of Levene's 'soft selection' model is developed as a specific example to demonstrate evolutionary dynamics and branching in monomorphic and polymorphic populations.},

We find that strong competitive asymmetry, high resource levels, and intermediate harshness of the precompetitive environment favor coexistence of plants with different seed sizes. If the evolution of seed size is mutation-limited and single mutations have only a small phenotypic effect, then an initially monomorphic population reaches the final evolutionarily stable polymorphic state through one or more discrete evolutionary branching events. At each such branching event, a given lineage already present in the population divides into two phenotypically diverging daughter lines, each with its own seed size. If the precompetitive survival of seeds and seedlings is high for small and large seeds alike, however, evolutionary branching may be followed by the extinction of one or more lineages. Various results presented here are model-independent and point the way to a more general evolutionary bifurcation theory describing how the number and stability properties of evolutionary equilibria may change as a consequence of changes in model parameters.},

We assessed the genetic changes of the first mutations acquired during adaptation to a novel environment (exposure to the fungicide, nystatin) in 35 haploid lines of Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Through whole-genome resequencing we found that the genomic scope for adaptation was narrow; all adapted lines acquired a mutation in one of four late-acting genes in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, with very few other mutations found. Lines that acquired different ergosterol mutations in the same gene exhibited very similar tolerance to nystatin. All lines were found to have a cost relative to wild type in an unstressful environment; the level of this cost was also strongly correlated with the ergosterol gene bearing the mutation. Interestingly, we uncovered both positive and negative effects on tolerance to other harsh environments for mutations in the different ergosterol genes, indicating that these beneficial mutations have effects that differ in sign among environmental challenges. These results demonstrate that although the genomic target was narrow, different adaptive mutations can lead populations down different evolutionary pathways, with respect to their ability to tolerate (or succumb to) other environmental challenges.},

  abstract = {1. The role of phenotypic plasticity in evolution has historically been a contentious issue because of debate over whether plasticity shields genotypes from selection or generates novel opportunities for selection to act. Because plasticity encompasses diverse adaptive and non-adaptive responses to environmental variation, no single conceptual framework adequately predicts the diverse roles of plasticity in evolutionary change. 2. Different types of phenotypic plasticity can uniquely contribute to adaptive evolution when populations are faced with new or altered environments. Adaptive plasticity should promote establishment and persistence in a new environment, but depending on how close the plastic response is to the new favoured phenotypic optimum dictates whether directional selection will cause adaptive divergence between populations. Further, non-adaptive plasticity in response to stressful environments can result in a mean phenotypic response being further away from the favoured optimum or alternatively increase the variance around the mean due to the expression of cryptic genetic variation. The expression of cryptic genetic variation can facilitate adaptive evolution if by chance it results in a fitter phenotype. 3. We conclude that adaptive plasticity that places populations close enough to a new phenotypic optimum for directional selection to act is the only plasticity that predictably enhances fitness and is most likely to facilitate adaptive evolution on ecological time-scales in new environments. However, this type of plasticity is likely to be the product of past selection on variation that may have been initially non-adaptive. 4. We end with suggestions on how future empirical studies can be designed to better test the importance of different kinds of plasticity to adaptive evolution. \textcopyright{} 2007 The Authors.},

  abstract = {Introduced and invasive species are major threats native species and communities and, quite naturally, most scientists and managers think of them in terms of ecological problems. However, species introductions are also experiments in evolution, both for the alien species and for the community that they colonize. We focus here on the introduced species because these offer opportunities to study the properties that allow a species to succeed in a novel habitat and the constraints that limit range expansion. Moreover, an increasing body of evidence from diverse taxa suggests that the introduced species often undergo rapid and observable evolutionary change in their new habitat. Evolution requires genetic variation, which may be decreased or expanded during an invasion, and an evolutionary mechanism such as genetic drift or natural selection. In this volume, we seek to understand how natural selection produces adaptive evolution during invasions. Key questions include what is the role of biotic and abiotic stress in driving adaptation, and what is the source of genetic variation in introduced populations.},

Moreover, a new find in Burmese amber locates the temporal boundary of the subfamily back to the mid-Cretaceous (probably \textasciitilde 100 Mya). We describe two new genera assigned to the tribe Pseudochironomini: Mesoacentron gen. nov. with the species Mesoacentron kaluginae sp. nov. (Taimyr amber) and Palaeocentron gen. nov. with the species Palaeocentron krzeminskii sp. nov. (Burmese amber), the oldest known representative of the subfamily. The systematic position of the new taxa is discussed, and a key to the identification of adult males of extinct and extant Pseudochironomini genera is presented. Insights in the phylogeny and diversification tempo of the Chironominae and Pseudochironomini in the past are also provided.},

Here, we developed and applied a binned genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) method to build dense genome-wide linkage maps of sticklebacks using two large marine by freshwater F2 crosses of more than 350 fish each. The resulting linkage maps significantly improve the genome assembly by anchoring 78 new scaffolds to chromosomes, reorienting 40 scaffolds, and rearranging scaffolds in 4 locations. In the revised genome assembly, 94.6\% of the assembly was anchored to a chromosome. To assess linkage map quality, we mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling lateral plate number, which mapped as expected to a 200-kb genomic region containing Ectodysplasin, as well as a chromosome 7 QTL overlapping a previously identified modifier QTL. Finally, we mapped eight QTL controlling convergently evolved reductions in gill raker length in the two crosses, which revealed that this classic adaptive trait has a surprisingly modular and nonparallel genetic basis.},

These still largely untested predictions complicate Darwin's hypothesis that more closely related species less easily coexist, and challenge the use of community phylogenetic patterns to infer competition. We field parameterised models of competitor dynamics with pairs of 18 California annual plant species, and then related species' niche and fitness differences to their phylogenetic distance. Stabilising niche differences were unrelated to phylogenetic distance, while species' average fitness showed phylogenetic structure. This meant that more distant relatives had greater competitive asymmetry, which should favour the coexistence of close relatives. Nonetheless, coexistence proved unrelated to phylogeny, due in part to increasing variance in fitness differences with phylogenetic distance, a previously overlooked property of such relationships. Together, these findings question the expectation that distant relatives should more readily coexist.},

However, whether trait differences between exotic and native species promote invasion success by enhancing niche differences or giving invaders competitive advantages is poorly understood. We explored the mechanisms by which phenology determines invasion success in a California annual plant community by quantifying how the seasonal timing of growth relates to niche differences that stabilize coexistence, and the competitive ability differences that drive dominance and exclusion. We parameterized models of community dynamics from experimentally assembled annual communities in which exotic plants displayed earlier, coincident, or later phenology than native residents. Using recent theoretical advances from the coexistence literature, we found that differences in phenology promote stabilizing niche differences between exotic and native species. However, phenology was more strongly related to competitive ability differences, allowing later invaders to outcompete earlier native competitors and native residents to outcompete earlier invaders in field experiments. Few of these insights could be inferred by comparing the competitive outcomes across invaders, highlighting the need to quantify niche and competitive ability differences when disentangling how species differences drive invasion success.},

  abstract = {Large mammalian herbivores (LMH) strongly influence plant communities, and these effects can propagate indirectly throughout food webs. Most existing large-scale manipulations of LMH presence/absence consist of a single exclusion treatment, and few are replicated across environmental gradients. Thus, important questions remain about the functional roles of different LMH, and how these roles depend on abiotic context. In September 2008, we constructed a series of 1-ha herbivore-exclusion plots across a 20-km rainfall gradient in central Kenya. Dubbed "UHURU" (Ungulate Herbivory Under Rainfall Uncertainty), this experiment aims to illuminate the ecological effects of three size classes of LMH, and how rainfall regimes shape the direction and magnitude of these effects. UHURU consists of four treatments: total-exclusion (all ungulate herbivores), mesoherbivore-exclusion (LMH \&gt;120-cm tall), megaherbivore-exclusion (elephants and giraffes), and unfenced open plots. Each treatment is replicated three times at three locations (``sites'') along the rainfall gradient: low (440 mm/year), intermediate (580 mm/year), and high (640 mm/year). There was limited variation across sites in soil attributes and LMH activity levels. Understory-plant cover was greater in plots without mesoherbivores, but did not respond strongly to the exclusion of megaherbivores, or to the additional exclusion of dik-dik and warthog. Eleven of the thirteen understory plant species that responded significantly to exclusion treatment were more common in exclusion plots than open ones. Significant interactions between site and treatment on plant communities, although uncommon, suggested that differences between treatments may be greater at sites with lower rainfall. Browsers reduced densities of several common overstory species, along with growth rates of the three dominant Acacia species. Small-mammal densities were 2\textendash 3 times greater in total-exclusion than in open plots at all sites. Although we expect patterns to become clearer with time, results from 2008\textendash 2012 show that the effects of excluding successively smaller-bodied subsets of the LMH community are generally non-additive for a given response variable, and inconsistent across response variables, indicating that the different LMH size classes are not functionally redundant. Several response variables showed significant treatment-by-site interactions, suggesting that the nature of plant-herbivore interactions can vary across restricted spatial scales.},

We generated a high-quality assembly of the gorilla genome using single-molecule, real-time sequence technology and a string graph de novo assembly algorithm. The new assembly improves contiguity by two to three orders of magnitude with respect to previously released assemblies, recovering 87\% of missing reference exons and incomplete gene models. Although regions of large, high-identity segmental duplications remain largely unresolved, this comprehensive assembly provides new biological insight into genetic diversity, structural variation, gene loss, and representation of repeat structures within the gorilla genome. The approach provides a path forward for the routine assembly of mammalian genomes at a level approaching that of the current quality of the human genome.},

  abstract = {An adaptationist programme has dominated evolutionary thought in England and the United States during the past 40 years. It is based on faith in the power of natural selection as an optimizing agent. It proceeds by breaking an organism into unitary 'traits' and proposing an adaptive story for each considered separately. Trade-offs among competing selective demands exert the only brake upon perfection; non-optimality is thereby rendered as a result of adaptation as well. We criticize this approach and attempt to reassert a competing notion (long popular in continental Europe) that organisms must be analysed as integrated wholes, with Bauplane so constrained by phyletic heritage, pathways of development and general architecture that the constraints themselves become more interesting and more important in delimiting pathways of change than the selective force that may mediate change when it occurs. We fault the adaptationist programme for its failure to distinguish current utility from reasons for origin (male tyrannosaurs may have used their diminutive front legs to titillate female partners, but this will not explain why they got so small); for its unwillingness to consider alternatives to adaptive stories; for its reliance upon plausibility alone as a criterion for accepting speculative tales; and for its failure to consider adequately such competing themes as random fixation of alleles, production of non-adaptive structures by developmental correlation with selected features (allometry, pleiotropy, material compensation, mechanically forced correlation), the separability of adaptation and selection, multiple adaptive peaks, and current utility as an epiphenomenon of non-adaptive structures. We support Darwin's own pluralistic approach to identifying the agents of evolutionary change.},

  abstract = {Modern coexistence theory is increasingly used to explain how differences between competing species lead to coexistence versus competitive exclusion. Although research testing this theory has focused on deterministic cases of competitive exclusion, in which the same species always wins, mounting evidence suggests that competitive exclusion is often historically contingent, such that whichever species happens to arrive first excludes the other. Coexistence theory predicts that historically contingent exclusion, known as priority effects, will occur when large destabilizing differences (positive frequency-dependent growth rates of competitors), combined with small fitness differences (differences in competitors' intrinsic growth rates and sensitivity to competition), create conditions under which neither species can invade an established population of its competitor. Here we extend the empirical application of modern coexistence theory to determine the conditions that promote priority effects. We conducted pairwise invasion tests with four strains of nectar-colonizing yeasts to determine how the destabilizing and fitness differences that drive priority effects are altered by two abiotic factors characterizing the nectar environment: Sugar concentration and pH. We found that higher sugar concentrations increased the likelihood of priority effects by reducing fitness differences between competing species. In contrast, higher pH did not change the likelihood of priority effects, but instead made competition more neutral by bringing both fitness differences and destabilizing differences closer to zero. This study demonstrates how the empirical partitioning of priority effects into fitness and destabilizing components can elucidate the pathways through which environmental conditions shape competitive interactions.},

However, in the long term evolution is unpredictable because environments, which determine the directions and magnitudes of selection coefficients, fluctuate unpredictably. These two features of evolution, the predictable and unpredictable, are demonstrated in a study of two populations of Darwin's finches on the Gal\'apagos island of Daphne Major. From 1972 to 2001, Geospiza fortis (medium ground finch) and Geospiza scandens (cactus finch) changed several times in body size and two beak traits. Natural selection occurred frequently in both species and varied from unidirectional to oscillating, episodic to gradual. Hybridization occurred repeatedly though rarely, resulting in elevated phenotypic variances in G. scandens and a change in beak shape. The phenotypic states of both species at the end of the 30-year study could not have been predicted at the beginning. Continuous, long-term studies are needed to detect and interpret rare but important events and nonuniform evolutionary change.},

First, we present a model of recruitment probabilities that combines both niche and neutral processes. From this model, we predict and test whether the relative importance of niche vs. neutral processes in controlling community dynamics will vary depending on community species richness, niche overlap and dispersal capabilities of species (both local and long distance). Results demonstrate that niche and neutrality form ends of a continuum from competitive to stochastic exclusion. In the absence of immigration, competitive exclusion tends to create a regular spacing of niches. However, immigration prevents the establishment of a limiting similarity. The equilibrium community consists of a set of complementary and redundant species, with their abundance determined, respectively, by the distribution of environmental conditions and the amount of immigration. \textcopyright{} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

I identify a series of key assumptions underlying the use of this method, each of which is likely to be violated in some or all studies. These assumptions are: (1) that the functional relationship between mass and BSI is linear; (2) that condition is independent of BSI length; (3) that BSI length accurately indicates structural size; (4) that there is no correlation between the size of BSI relative to other structural components (i.e., shape) and the parameter against which the residuals are analyzed; (5) that BSI length is strictly independent of mass; and (6) that BSI length is not subjected to error.

  abstract = {In multiply invaded ecosystems, introduced species should interact with each other as well as with native species. Invader-invader interactions may affect the success of further invaders by altering attributes of recipient communities and propagule pressure. The invasional meltdown hypothesis (IMH) posits that positive interactions among invaders initiate positive population-level feedback that intensifies impacts and promotes secondary invasions. IMH remains controversial: few studies show feedback between invaders that amplifies their effects, and none yet demonstrate facilitation of entry and spread of secondary invaders. Our results show that supercolonies of an alien ant, promoted by mutualism with introduced honeydew-secreting scale insects, permitted invasion by an exotic land snail on Christmas Island, Indian Ocean. Modeling of land snail spread over 750 sites across 135 km2 over seven years showed that the probability of land snail invasion was facilitated 253-fold in ant supercolonies but impeded in intact forest where predaceous native land crabs remained abundant. Land snail occurrence at neighboring sites, a measure of propagule pressure, also promoted land snail spread. Site comparisons and experiments revealed that ant supercolonies, by killing land crabs but not land snails, disrupted biotic resistance and provided enemy-free space. Predation pressure on land snails was lower (28.6\%), survival 115 times longer, and abundance 20-fold greater in supercolonies than in intact forest. Whole-ecosystem suppression of supercolonies reversed the probability of land snail invasion by allowing recolonization of land crabs; land snails were much less likely (0.79\%) to invade sites where supercolonies were suppressed than where they remained intact. Our results provide strong empirical evidence for IMH by demonstrating that mutualism between invaders reconfigures key interactions in the recipient community. This facilitates entry of secondary invaders and elevates propagule pressure, propagating their spread at the whole-ecosystem level. We show that identification and management of key facilitative interactions in invaded ecosystems can be used to reverse impacts and restore resistance to further invasions.},

On beaches along the Manu River of southeastern Peru, four bird species (Black Skimmer, Rvnchops niger; Large-billed Tern, Phaetusa simplex; Yellow-billed Tern, Sterna superciliaris; Sand-colored Nighthawk, Chordeiles rupestris) nest in mixed-species associations. Costs and benefits of the association were distributed asymmetrically among the species. Nighthawks never actively defended their nests against predators. Terns and skimmers defended their nests by aggressively mobbing predators, and indirectly defended nearby or adjacent nests of nighthawks. As a result, nighthawks had greater hatching success when nesting near terns and skimmers. Terns and skimmers spent more time engaged in antipredator behaviors and being vigilant, but less time in parental care, and experienced lowered hatching success when among large nighthawk groups. In addition, both tern species fledged significantly fewer young per successful nest when nesting with many nighthawks. Results of this study demonstrate the first known parasitic relationship among members of a mixed-species nesting group.},

Simple rules based on equilibrium nutrient concentration (R*) and herbivore density (H*) have been proposed to govern competitive outcomes, but these earlier analyses assumed linearity of the nutrient-dependent plant growth function and the herbivore functional response. We now relax these assumptions. When plant growth is nonlinear, there is a rich set of potential trade-offs among plant competitive ability, plant maximal growth rate, plant defenses against herbivores, and preferences of herbivore attack on plants. Given stability, asymptotic outcomes can include exclusion of one plant species, priority effects wherein exclusion depends on initial conditions, and herbivore-mediated coexistence. Nonlinear herbivore functional responses potentially frustrate the application of simple rules for competitive outcomes. Nevertheless, there are circumstances in which simple rules appear to perform well. In these cases, graphical theory relates properties of food chains (nutrient, herbivore, and one plant species only) to asymptotic outcomes in food webs (with both plant species). Competitive outcomes in the graphical theory are summarized by R* and H* quantities. Our approach works best when plant species differ greatly in nutrient-dependent growth rates, and herbivores preferentially attack plants with high ratios of nutritional benefit to cost (measured by handling and processing times). A parameterized model of Daphnia and several algal species suggests that our approach could perform well in practice.},

The summer-winter difference represented more than a ninefold reduction in energy expenditure and water flux. However, individual V. varius could manipulate their energy and water requirements by up to sixfold during the summer period by regulating activity. Although we found no adaptive benefits of increased or decreased level of activity, we did find that larger animals moved more frequently and over greater distances than smaller animals.

However, these long reads are usually error-prone, making the generation of a haploid reference out of a diploid genome a difficult enterprise. Failure to properly collapse haplotypes results in fragmented and structurally incorrect assemblies and wreaks havoc on orthology inference pipelines, yet this serious issue is rarely acknowledged and dealt with in genomic projects, and an independent, comparative benchmark of the capacity of assemblers and post-processing tools to properly collapse or purge haplotypes is still lacking. Results: We tested different assembly strategies on the genome of the rotifer Adineta vaga, a non-model organism for which high coverages of both PacBio and Nanopore reads were available. The assemblers we tested (Canu, Flye, NextDenovo, Ra, Raven, Shasta and wtdbg2) exhibited strikingly different behaviors when dealing with highly heterozygous regions, resulting in variable amounts of uncollapsed haplotypes. Filtering reads generally improved haploid assemblies, and we also benchmarked three post-processing tools aimed at detecting and purging uncollapsed haplotypes in long-read assemblies: HaploMerger2, purge\_haplotigs and purge\_dups. Conclusions: We provide a thorough evaluation of popular assemblers on a non-model eukaryote genome with variable levels of heterozygosity. Our study highlights several strategies using pre and post-processing approaches to generate haploid assemblies with high continuity and completeness. This benchmark will help users to improve haploid assemblies of non-model organisms, and evaluate the quality of their own assemblies.},

Contaminants in the lake also have been derived from extensive agricultural activities around the lake that continue today and a sewage treatment facility associated with the city of Winter Garden, Florida. We examined the hypothesis that an estrogenic contaminant has caused the current failure in recruitment of alligators on Lake Apopka. Supporting data include the following: At 6 months of age, female alligators from Lake Apopka had plasma estradiol-17 beta concentrations almost two times greater than normal females from the control lake, Lake Woodruff. The Apopka females exhibited abnormal ovarian morphology with large numbers of polyovular follicles and polynuclear oocytes. Male juvenile alligators had significantly depressed plasma testosterone concentrations comparable to levels observed in normal Lake Woodruff females but more than three times lower than normal Lake Woodruff males. Additionally, males from Lake Apopka had poorly organized testes and abnormally small phalli. The differences between lakes and sexes in plasma hormone concentrations of juvenile alligators remain even after stimulation with luteinizing hormone. Our data suggest that the gonads of juveniles from Lake Apopka have been permanently modified in ovo, so that normal steroidogenesis is not possible, and thus normal sexual maturation is unlikely.},

We have observed that a population of juvenile alligators living on Lake Apopka exhibit significantly smaller penis size (24\% average decrease) and lower plasma concentra- tions of testosterone (70\% lower concentrations) when compared to animals of similar size on Lake Woodruff. In addition to smaller phalli, no relationship exists be- tween plasma testosterone concentrations and penile size in males from Lake Apopka, whereas a positive re- lationship exists for males from Lake Woodruff. The alligators on Lake Apopka are known to have elevated concentrations of the antiandrogenic DDT breakdown product p,p?-DDE stored in their fat. We suggest a num- ber of hypotheses that could explain the modification in the phenotype of the juvenile male living in Lake Apopka. These modifications in phenotype include a smaller penis size, lower plasma androgen concentra- tions, and lack of responsiveness of the penis to the plasma androgens present.},

Females with vitellogenic follicles were observed throughout the year, although ovaries containing follicles larger than 15 mm were seen only during the spring and early summer (March\textendash June). We detected a poor relationship between female body size and the number of vitellogenic follicles whereas body size was significantly correlated with clutch size. Plasma samples were analyzed for (1) estra- diol-17? (E2), testosterone (T), and corticosterone by specific radioimmunoassays; (2) vitellogenin by one- dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate\textendash polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and (3) total protein, phosphorus, and calcium by spectrophotometric assays. Reproductively active females showed elevated plasma concentrations of E2 during the fall (September\textendash November) and spring (March\textendash May) whereas non-reproductively active females exhibited basal levels with no apparent peaks. Vitello- genin was detected in the plasma during the same months that plasma E2 concentrations were elevated. Elevated plasma vitellogenin and E2 were not correlated with plasma total protein but were correlated with plasma calcium concentration. During late vitellogen- esis, plasma T concentrations were elevated in reproduc- tively active females coincident with a period of intense courtship and mating. Corticosterone plasma concentra- tions exhibit no significant monthly variation, nor appar- ent changes during various stages of reproductive activ- ity although plasma concentrations were elevated during late gravidity. Our data suggest that female reproductive activity begins in the fall with an increase in plasma E2 concentration in September or October and vitellogen- esis in October. Ovarian activity slows during winter and reactivates with the onset of spring.},

Advances in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools allow population genomics to exploit genome-\-wide information to identify the molecular variants underlying traits of interest and the evolutionary forces that modulate these variants through space and time. However, the cost of genomic analyses of multiple populations is still too high to address them through individual genome sequencing. Pooling individuals for sequencing can be a more effective strategy in Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) detection and allele frequency estimation because of a higher total coverage. However, compared to individual sequencing, SNP calling from pools has the additional difficulty of distinguishing rare variants from sequencing errors, which is often avoided by establishing a minimum threshold allele frequency for the analysis. Finding an optimal balance between minimizing information loss and reducing sequencing costs is essential to ensure the success of population genomics studies. Here, we have benchmarked the performance of SNP callers for Pool-\-seq data, based on different approaches, under different conditions, and using computer simulations and real data. We found that SNP callers performance varied for allele frequencies up to 0.35. We also found that SNP callers based on Bayesian (SNAPE-\-pooled) or maximum likelihood (MAPGD) approaches outperform the two heuristic callers tested (VarScan and PoolSNP), in terms of the balance between sensitivity and FDR both in simulated and sequencing data. Our results will help inform the selection of the most appropriate SNP caller not only for large-\-scale population studies but also in cases where the Pool-\-seq strategy is the only option, such as in metagenomic or polyploid studies.},

  abstract = {Comparing allele frequencies among populations that differ in environment has long been a tool for detecting loci involved in local adaptation. However, such analyses are complicated by an imperfect knowledge of population allele frequencies and neutral correlations of allele frequencies among populations due to shared population history and gene flow. Here we develop a set of methods to robustly test for unusual allele frequency patterns and correlations between environmental variables and allele frequencies while accounting for these complications based on a Bayesian model previously implemented in the software Bayenv. Using this model, we calculate a set of ``standardized allele frequencies'' that allows investigators to apply tests of their choice to multiple populations while accounting for sampling and covariance due to population history. We illustrate this first by showing that these standardized frequencies can be used to detect nonparametric correlations with environmental variables; these correlations are also less prone to spurious results due to outlier populations. We then demonstrate how these standardized allele frequencies can be used to construct a test to detect SNPs that deviate strongly from neutral population structure. This test is conceptually related to F ST and is shown to be more powerful, as we account for population history. We also extend the model to next-generation sequencing of population pools\textemdash a cost-efficient way to estimate population allele frequencies, but one that introduces an additional level of sampling noise. The utility of these methods is demonstrated in simulations and by reanalyzing human SNP data from the Human Genome Diversity Panel populations and pooled next-generation sequencing data from Atlantic herring. An implementation of our method is available from {$<$}http://gcbias.org{$>$}.},

  abstract = {Anhydrobiotic chironomid larvae can withstand prolonged complete desiccation as well as other external stresses including ionizing radiation. To understand the cross-tolerance mechanism, we have analyzed the structural changes in the nuclear DNA using transmission electron microscopy and DNA comet assays in relation to anhydrobiosis and radiation. We found that dehydration causes alterations in chromatin structure and a severe fragmentation of nuclear DNA in the cells of the larvae despite successful anhydrobiosis. Furthermore, while the larvae had restored physiological activity within an hour following rehydration, nuclear DNA restoration typically took 72 to 96 h. The DNA fragmentation level and the recovery of DNA integrity in the rehydrated larvae after anhydrobiosis were similar to those of hydrated larvae irradiated with 70 Gy of high-linear energy transfer (LET) ions (4He). In contrast, low-LET radiation (gamma-rays) of the same dose caused less initial damage to the larvae, and DNA was completely repaired within within 24 h. The expression of genes encoding the DNA repair enzymes occurred upon entering anhydrobiosis and exposure to high- and low-LET radiations, indicative of DNA damage that includes double-strand breaks and their subsequent repair. The expression of antioxidant enzymes-coding genes was also elevated in the anhydrobiotic and the gamma-ray-irradiated larvae that probably functions to reduce the negative effect of reactive oxygen species upon exposure to these stresses. Indeed the mature antioxidant proteins accumulated in the dry larvae and the total activity of antioxidants increased by a 3\textendash 4 fold in association with anhydrobiosis. We conclude that one of the factors explaining the relationship between radioresistance and the ability to undergo anhydrobiosis in the sleeping chironomid could be an adaptation to desiccation-inflicted nuclear DNA damage. There were also similarities in the molecular response of the larvae to damage caused by desiccation and ionizing radiation.},

The interaction between ants and nesting birds exhibits such variability, ants sometimes being predators of bird nests and other times protectors of them. Hypothesizing that predation risk might be a critical factor in altering the interaction of ants with birds, I investigated the interaction of wood ants Formica aquilonia with nesting birds under different levels of predation risk. In a controlled field experiment, I allowed tits (Parus major, P. caeruleus, P. ater) and pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) to select nest boxes in trees with ants (ant trees) or trees without ants. I found that birds usually nested in trees without ants, apparently to avoid the danger of injury from encounters with ants. Nesting in ant trees occurred mainly in the habitat where risk of predation was highest (along the forest edge), and with the bird taxa that lost nests most frequently in trees without ants (tits). Tits nesting on the forest edge achieved significantly greater nesting success, and fledged significantly more young, in ant trees compared with trees without ants. As the season progressed, ant traffic increased in trees without nesting birds, but decreased in trees with nesting birds, indicating that the outcome of interference competition between ants and nesting birds was reversed under increased predation risk. These results support the idea that predation risk can shift species interactions from predominately competitive processes to predominately facilitative processes.},

Yet this trade-off, commonly found among species occupying divergent resource environments, may not occur across populations of single species. We hypothesized that more favorable climates and higher levels of herbivory would lead to increases in growth and defense across plant populations. We evaluated whether plant growth and defense traits covaried across 18 populations of showy milkweed (Asclepias speciosa) inhabiting an east-west climate gradient spanning 25 degrees of longitude. A suite of traits impacting defense (e.g., latex, cardenolides), growth (e.g., size), or both (e.g., specific leaf area [SLA], trichomes) were measured in natural populations and in a common garden, allowing us to evaluate plastic and genetically based variation in these traits. In natural populations, herbivore pressure increased toward warmer sites with longer growing seasons. Growth and defense traits showed strong clinal patterns and were positively correlated. In a common garden, clines with climatic origin were recapitulated only for defense traits. Correlations between growth and defense traits were also weaker and more negative in the common garden than in the natural populations. Thus, our data suggest that climatically favorable sites likely facilitate the evolution of greater defense at minimal costs to growth, likely because of increased resource acquisition.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have documented rates of evolution of ecologically important phenotypes sufficiently fast that they have the potential to impact the outcome of ecological interactions while they are underway. Observations of this type go against accepted wisdom that ecological and evolutionary dynamics occur at very different time scales. While some authors have evaluated the rapidity of a measured evolutionary rate by comparing it to the overall distribution of measured evolutionary rates, we believe that ecologists are mainly interested in rapid evolution because of its potential to impinge on ecological processes. We therefore propose that rapid evolution be defined as a genetic change occurring rapidly enough to have a measurable impact on simultaneous ecological change. Using this definition we propose a framework for decomposing rates of ecological change into components driven by simultaneous evolutionary change and by change in a non-evolutionary factor (e.g. density dependent population dynamics, abiotic environmental change). Evolution is judged to be rapid in this ecological context if its contribution to ecological change is large relative to the contribution of other factors. We provide a worked example of this approach based on a theoretical predator-prey interaction [Abrams, P. \& Matsuda, H. (1997). Evolution, 51, 1740], and find that in this system the impact of prey evolution on predator per capita growth rate is 63\% that of internal ecological dynamics. We then propose analytical methods for measuring these contributions in field situations, and apply them to two long-term data sets for which suitable ecological and evolutionary data exist. For both data sets relatively high rates of evolutionary change have been found when measured as character change in standard deviations per generation (haldanes). For Darwin's finches evolving in response to fluctuating rainfall [Grant, P.R. \& Grant, B.R. (2002). Science, 296, 707], we estimate that evolutionary change has been more rapid than ecological change by a factor of 2.2. For a population of freshwater copepods whose life history evolves in response to fluctuating fish predation [Hairston, N.G. Jr \& Dillon, T.A. (1990). Evolution, 44, 1796], we find that evolutionary change has been about one quarter the rate of ecological change - less than in the finch example, but nevertheless substantial. These analyses support the view that in order to understand temporal dynamics in ecological processes it is critical to consider the extent to which the attributes of the system under investigation are simultaneously changing as a result of rapid evolution.},

However, in spite of increasing number of studies in forested landscapes reporting reproductive success benefits when nesting near protective associates, studies examining whether protective effects vary with food availability for the top predator are lacking. We asked whether the nest predation on ground nests of birds in Ural Owl (Strix uralensis) territories is dependent on varying food conditions for the owl. This was studied using dummy nests placed at different distances from the Ural Owl nests and repeating the study in different food conditions for the owls (low, increase and peak phases of the vole cycle). The proportion of predated dummy nests differed between different food conditions for Ural Owls being lowest in a low vole year. The distance from the owl nest affected the predation of dummy nests, but only in intermediate food conditions. Due to the lack of control nests located outside the owl territories, we are not able to draw conclusions about the background variation in the nest predation in different food conditions. We hypothesise that fluctuating prey availability for the top predator species under concern may have significant effects on the outcome of species interactions. This currently unexplored idea should be tested further, e.g. by including multiple breeding seasons in the future studies on protective nesting associations.},

Violation of the first guideline can seriously reduce the power of a test. Sometimes this reduction is spectacular, since it is most serious when the null hypothesis is grossly in error. The second guideline is of some importance when the conclusion of a test is equivocal. It has no direct bearing on power, but improves the level accuracy of a test.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an antithesis to the view that gregarious behaviour is evolved through benefits to the population or species. Following  Galton (1871) and Williams (1964) gregarious behaviour is considered as a form of cover-seeking in which each animal tries to reduce its chance of being caught by a predator. It is easy to see how pruning of marginal individuals can maintain centripetal instincts in already gregarious species; some evidence that marginal pruning actually occurs is summarized. Besides this, simply defined models are used to show that even in non-gregarious species selection is likely to favour individuals who stay close to others. Although not universal or unipotent, cover-seeking is a widespread and important element in animal aggregation, as the literature shows. Neglect of the idea has probably followed from a general disbelief that evolution can be dysgenic for a species. Nevertheless, selection theory provides no support for such disbelief in the case of species with outbreeding or unsubdivided populations. The model for two dimensions involves a complex problem in geometrical probability which has relevance also in metallurgy and communication science. Some empirical data on this, gathered from random number plots, is presented as of possible heuristic value.},

The Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge (MI) is a unique barrier island environment and home to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Seasonal patterns of sex steroids were assessed in adult female American alligators from MI monthly from 2008 and 2009, with additional samples collected at more random intervals in 2006, 2007 and 2010. Plasma 17{$\beta$}-estradiol concentrations peaked in April, coincident with courtship and mating, and showed patterns similar to those observed in adult female alligators in other regions. Plasma concentrations of progesterone, however, showed patterns distinctly different than that reported for alligator populations in other regions, and remained relatively constant throughout the year. Plasma dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) peaked in July around the time of oviposition, and decreased in August where it remained constant for the remaining months, except for a moderate increase in October. Circulating concentrations of DHEA have not been previously assessed in a female crocodilian, and plasma concentrations coincident with reproductive activity suggests a reproductive and/or behavioral role. Interestingly, plasma testosterone (T) concentrations peaked in May of 2008, as has been shown in female alligator populations in other regions, but showed no peak in 2009, demonstrating dramatic variability from year to year. Surveys showed 2009 to be particularly depauperate of alligator nests in MI, and it is possible T could serve as a strong indicator of breeding success.},

We first evaluated the performance of three popular CGI identification algorithms in four fish genomes (tetraodon, stickleback, medaka, and zebrafish). Our results suggest that Takai and Jones' (2002) algorithm is most suitable for comparative analysis of CGIs in the fish genome. Then, we performed a systematic analysis of CGIs in the four fish genomes using Takai and Jones' algorithm, compared to other vertebrate genomes. We found that both the number of CGIs and the CGI density vary greatly among these genomes. Remarkably, each fish genome presents a distinct distribution of CGI density with some genomic factors (e.g., chromosome size and chromosome GC content). These findings are helpful for understanding evolution of fish genomes and the features of fish CGIs.},

The number of species in an ecosystem and their traits are key predictors of many ecosystem-level processes, such as rates of productivity, biomass sequestration and decomposition(4,5). Here we demonstrate short-term ecosystem-level effects of adaptive radiation in the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) over the past 10,000 years. These fish have undergone recent parallel diversification in several lakes in coastal British Columbia, resulting in the formation of two specialized species (benthic and limnetic) from a generalist ancestor(6). Using a mesocosm experiment, we demonstrate that this diversification has strong effects on ecosystems, affecting prey community structure, total primary production, and the nature of dissolved organic materials that regulate the spectral properties of light transmission in the system. However, these ecosystem effects do not simply increase in their relative strength with increasing specialization and species richness; instead, they reflect the complex and indirect consequences of ecosystem engineering by sticklebacks. It is well known that ecological factors influence adaptive radiation(7,8). We demonstrate that adaptive radiation, even over short timescales, can have profound effects on ecosystems.},

After a one-month acclimation period in the laboratory, we grouped snakes into three treatments, giving them access to water that was fresh (salinity of 0, control), brackish (salinity of 10), or full-strength sea water (salinity of 35). Hatchlings survived about one month at the highest marine salinity and about five months at the brackish-water salinity; no control animals perished during the experiment. These results are indicative of a ``worst-case scenario'', as in the laboratory we denied access to alternate fresh-water sources that may be accessible in the wild (e.g., through rainfall). Therefore, our results may underestimate the potential of hatchling pythons to persist in saline habitats in the wild. Because of the effect of different salinity regimes on survival, predictions of ultimate geographic expansion by non-native Burmese pythons that consider salt water as barriers to dispersal for pythons may warrant re-evaluation, especially under global climate change and associated sea-level-rise scenarios.},

Stress/ disturbance gradient models of community organization, such as the stress gradient hypothesis, emphasize a diminished role for competition in harsh environments whereas modern coexistence theory does not. Confusion about the role of species interactions in harsh environments is perpetuated by a disconnect between population dynamics theory and data. We linked theory and data using response surface experiments done in the field to parameterize mathematical, population-dynamic competition models. We replicated our experiment across two environments that spanned a common and important environmental stress gradient for determining community structure in benthic marine systems. We generated quantitative estimates of the effects of environmental stress on population growth rates and the direction and strength of intra- and interspecific interactions within each environment. Our approach directly addressed a perpetual blind spot in this field by showing how the effects of competition can be intensified in stressful environments even though the apparent strength of competition remains unchanged. Furthermore, we showed how simultaneous, reciprocal competitive and facilitative effects can stabilize population dynamics in multispecies communities in stressful environments.},

Classic theory shows that interspecific competition may select for traits that increase niche differentiation, weakening competition and thus promoting species coexistence. While empirical work has demonstrated trait evolution in response to competition, if and how evolution affects the dynamics of the competing species\textemdash the key step for completing the required eco-evolutionary feedback\textemdash has been difficult to resolve. Here, we show that evolution in response to interspecific competition feeds back to change the course of competitive population dynamics of aquatic plant species over 10\textendash 15 generations in the field. By manipulating selection imposed by heterospecific competitors in experimental ponds, we demonstrate that (               i               ) interspecific competition drives rapid genotypic change, and (               ii               ) this evolutionary change in one competitor, while not changing the coexistence outcome, causes the population trajectories of the two competing species to converge. In contrast to the common expectation that interspecific competition should drive the evolution of niche differentiation, our results suggest that genotypic evolution resulted in phenotypic changes that altered population dynamics by affecting the competitive hierarchy. This result is consistent with theory suggesting that competition for essential resources can limit opportunities for the evolution of niche differentiation. Our finding that rapid evolution regulates the dynamics of competing species suggests that ecosystems may rely on continuous feedbacks between ecology and evolution to maintain species diversity.},

  abstract = {Explicit consideration of timescales and dynamics is required for an understanding of fundamental issues in ecology. Endogenous dynamics can lead to transient states where asymptotic behavior is very different from dynamics on short timescales. The causes of these kinds of transients can be placed in one of three classes: linear systems with different timescales embedded or exhibiting reactive behavior, the potentially long times to reach synchrony across space for oscillating systems, and the complex dynamics of systems with strong density-dependent (nonlinear) interactions. It is also important to include the potentially disparate timescales inherent in ecological systems when determining the endogenous dynamics. I argue that the dynamics of ecological systems can best be understood as the response, which may include transient dynamics, to exogenous influences leading to the observed dynamics on ecologically relevant timescales. This view of ecosystem behavior as responses of ecological systems governed by endogenous dynamics to exogenous influences provides a synthetic way to unify different approaches to population dynamics, to understand mechanisms that determine the distribution and abundance of species, and to manage ecosystems on appropriate timescales. There are implications for theoretical approaches, empirical approaches, and the statistical approaches that bridge theory and observation. \textcopyright{} 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.},

The rationale for this hypothesis is that parasitoid longevity and fecundity can be greatly enhanced by sugar meals and that many agricultural areas are devoid of naturally occurring sugar sources. While some experimental field studies have produced results supporting the nectar provision hypotheses, many others have failed to show that supplemental nectar can improve biological control by parasitoids. I propose that some parasitoids may engage in medium- or long-range dispersal upon feeding on nectar and thus not contribute to local parasitism adjacent to flower plantings. If true, this could help to explain some of the negative results of nectar supplementation experiments. I further propose that certain conditions favor nectar-induced dispersal and discuss four of these here: (i) the risk of self-superparasitism, (ii) the risk of density-dependent hyperparasitism, (iii) benefits of 'spreading the risk' of catastrophic mortality and (iv) the risk of inbreeding among parasitoid offspring.},

Isotopic analyses indicate that trees and shrubs near spawning streams derive {$\sim$}22-24\% of their foliar nitrogen (N) from spawning salmon. As a consequence of this nutrient subsidy, growth rates are significantly increased in Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) near spawning streams. As riparian forests affect the quality of instream habitat through shading, sediment and nutrient filtration, and production of large woody debris (LWD), this fertilization process serves not only to enhance riparian production, but may also act as a positive feedback mechanism by which salmon-borne nutrients improve spawning and rearing habitat for subsequent salmon generations and maintain the long-term productivity of river corridors along the Pacific coast of North America.},

  abstract = {For centuries, biogeographers have examined the factors that pro- duce patterns of biodiversity across regions. The study of islands has proved particularly fruitful and has led to the theory that geographic area and isolation influence species colonization, extinction and spe- ciation such that larger islands have more species and isolated islands have fewer species (that is, positive species\textendash area and negative species\textendash{} isolation relationships)1\textendash 4. However, experimental tests of this theory have been limited, owing to the difficulty in experimental manipu- lation of islands at the scales at which speciation and long-distance colonization are relevant5. Here we have used the human-aided trans- port of exotic anole lizards among Caribbean islands as such a test at an appropriate scale. In accord with theory, as anole colonizations have increased, islands impoverished in native species have gained the most exotic species, the past influence of speciation on island bio- geography has been obscured, and the species\textendash area relationship has strengthened while the species\textendash isolation relationship has weakened. Moreover, anole biogeography increasingly reflects anthropogenic rather than geographic processes. Unlike the island biogeography of the past that was determined by geographic area and isolation, in the Anthropocene\textemdash an epoch proposed for the present time interval\textemdash{} island biogeography is dominated by the economic isolation of human populations.},

  abstract = {Abstract. How do female desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) reproduce every year despite variability in winter rainfall and food availability? To answer this question, I mea- sured energy budgets of individual female desert tortoises from July 1987 to July 1989. Females produced eggs in years with low levels of winter annual plants by relaxing their control of energy and water homeostasis. They tolerated large deficits and surpluses in their body dry-matter composition (both nonlipid and lipid) on a seasonal, annual, and longer time scale. They could increase body energy content (lipid and nonlipid energy) before winter and use this reserve (especially nonlipid energy) the following spring to produce eggs. Females used high-protein foods and rainwater, when available, to achieve energy surpluses that helped them survive periods of low resource availability (e.g., during hi- bernation and droughts). Adjusting seasonal and annual field metabolic rates (FMR) and food requirements to levels of food availability, they still managed to produce eggs, even in a drought year. Egg production in 1988 (mean ? 1 SD: 3.56 ? 1.94 eggs, N ? 9) did not differ from that in 1989 (3.00 ? 2.69 eggs, N ? 9); both were lower than during 1983\textendash 1987 (6.75 ? 3.05 eggs, N ? 100). Energy per se did not limit egg production in 1988 and 1989, but the availability of nonlipid energy (probably protein) limited egg production in 1988 and was limiting in spring 1989. Yet, water was the primary resource limiting egg production in 1989. Females forgoing egg production in 1989 accumulated body nonlipid energy and lost less total body water than did females producing eggs. Females that produced eggs in 1989 forfeited body nonlipid energy. In 1988 and 1989, the paucity of new annual plants in spring contributed to a lower egg production. The amount of annuals that germinate in summer can affect egg production, because females stored nonlipid energy during summer 1988 when eating these annuals, and allocated this energy to eggs in the following spring (1989). Tortoises stored lipids during summer when consuming dry annuals. These lipids are critical for surviving the winter, but females forfeited body water and nonlipid dry matter to digest the dry annuals. Reproductive effort (RE) was higher during the drought year (July 1988\textendash July 1989: RE ? 26.1\%) than during the wetter year (July 1987\textendash July 1988: RE ? 13.0\%) because tortoises reduced FMR by 70\textendash 90\% in 1989. Compared to two other chelonians, RE of desert tortoises was consistent with the K-selected trend of lower RE for larger, long-lived, and late-maturing species. Forfeiting body condition to produce only a few eggs, even under a great envi- ronmental stress, was consistent with a life history strategy called bet hedging.},

For an animal with such a low metabolic rate, the heart rate is relatively rapid, in part because the heart is relatively small. Metabolic rate of the smallest alligator exceeds that of the largest by about 25 to 1. Lowering the temperature decreases blood flow without decreasing the oxygen and substrate extracted from each liter. Metabolic rate (oxygen consumption) is expressed by the equation M.R. = F(A - V), where F is the blood flow and A - V is the oxygen A - V difference. For the catabolism of compounds in which oxygen is not directly involved, the expression is V = KF[S], where V is the velocity of the reaction, F is the blood flow, and [S] is the concentration of the substrate. K is a constant, differing for each catabolite, but having about the same value for any one catabolite in vertebrates, cold- or warm-blooded. Enzyme kinetics in a live vertebrate has little in common with that determined in the usual experiments in vitro. A 70 kg alligator at 28\textdegree C has a blood flow of 0.2 liters/min, a stroke volume of 6.3 ml, a circulation time of 27 min, and it produces about 72 kcal/day, or about 4\% of that of a man of equal size.},

This study examines this hypothesis for the specialized nectar-dwelling, clonal yeast Metschnikowia reukaufii (Ascomycota, Saccharomycetales). We examined whether M. reukaufii subpopulations associated with flowers of different host plant species, and different individuals of the same host species, differed in genetic characteristics. Amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) fingerprints of M. reukaufii strains isolated from floral nectar of different host species and individuals sampled at different spatial scales revealed a strong host-mediated component of genetic and genotypic diversity at all scales considered. Genotypes were nonrandomly distributed among flowers of different species and, in the case of the single host species studied in detail (Helleborus foetidus), also among flowers of conspecific individuals coexisting locally. These host-mediated patterns of genetic structuring are compatible with those expected under the diversifying selection hypothesis for the maintenance of local and regional genetic diversity in clonal organisms. It is proposed that a combination of intrafloral selection and biased pollinator-mediated migration may ultimately account for observed host-mediated genetic structuring in populations of M. reukaufii. \textcopyright{} 2013 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.},

Geographic isolation is the traditional explanation for diversification, but recent theoretical and empirical studies have shown that frequency-dependent selection can drive diversification without isolation and that adaptive diversification occurring in sympatry may be an important source of biological diversity. However, there are no empirical examples in which sympatric lineage splits have been understood at the genetic level, and it is unknown how predictable this process is-that is, whether similar ecological settings lead to parallel evolutionary dynamics of diversification. We documented the genetic basis and the evolutionary dynamics of adaptive diversification in three replicate evolution experiments, in which competition for two carbon sources caused initially isogenic populations of the bacterium Escherichia coli to diversify into two coexisting ecotypes representing different physiological adaptations in the central carbohydrate metabolism. Whole-genome sequencing of clones of each ecotype from different populations revealed many parallel and some unique genetic changes underlying the derived phenotypes, including changes to the same genes and sometimes to the same nucleotide. Timelines of allele frequencies extracted from the frozen "fossil" record of the three evolving populations suggest parallel evolutionary dynamics driven at least in part by a co-evolutionary process in which mutations causing one type of physiology changed the ecological environment, allowing the invasion of mutations causing an alternate physiology. This process closely corresponds to the evolutionary dynamics seen in mathematical models of adaptive diversification due to frequency-dependent ecological interactions. The parallel genetic changes underlying similar phenotypes in independently evolved lineages provide empirical evidence of adaptive diversification as a predictable evolutionary process.},

  abstract = {Consumer-resource interactions are fundamental components of ecological communities. Classic features of consumer-resource models are that temporal dynamics are often cyclic, with a 1/4-period lag between resource and consumer population peaks. However, there are few published empirical examples of this pattern. Here, we show that many published examples of consumer-resource cycling show instead patterns indicating eco-evolutionary dynamics. When prey evolve along a trade-off between defence and competitive ability, two-species consumer-resource cycles become longer and antiphase (half-period lag, so consumer maxima coincide with minima of the resource species). Using stringent criteria, we identified 21 two-species consumer-resource time series, published between 1934 and 1997, suitable to investigate for eco-evolutionary dynamics. We developed a statistical method to probe for a transition from classic to eco-evolutionary cycles, and find evidence for eco-evolutionary type cycles in about half of the studies. We show that rapid prey evolution is the most likely explanation for the observed patterns. \textcopyright{} 2014 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd/CNRS.},

  abstract = {Recognizing when and how rapid evolution drives ecological change is fundamental for our understanding of almost all ecological and evolutionary processes such as community assembly, genetic diversification and the stability of communities and ecosystems. Generally, rapid evolutionary change is driven through selection on genetic variation and is affected by evolutionary constraints, such as tradeoffs and pleiotropic effects, all contributing to the overall rate of evolutionary change. Each of these processes can be influenced by the presence of multiple environmental stressors reducing a population's reproductive output. Potential consequences of multistressor selection for the occurrence and strength of the link from rapid evolution to ecological change are unclear. However, understanding these is necessary for predicting when rapid evolution might drive ecological change. Here we investigate how the presence of two stressors affects this link using experimental evolution with the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens and its predator Tetrahymena thermophila. We show that the combination of predation and sublethal antibiotic concentrations delays the evolution of anti-predator defence and antibiotic resistance compared with the presence of only one of the two stressors. Rapid defence evolution drives stabilization of the predator\textendash prey dynamics but this link between evolution and ecology is weaker in the two-stressor environment, where defence evolution is slower, leading to less stable population dynamics. Tracking the molecular evolution of whole populations over time shows further that mutations in different genes are favoured under multistressor selection. Overall, we show that selection by multiple stressors can significantly alter eco-evolutionary dynamics and their predictability.},

  abstract = {Historically, terrestrial food web theory has been compartmentalized into interactions among aboveground or belowground communities. In this study we took a more synthetic approach to understanding food web interactions by simultaneously examining four trophic levels and investigating how nutrient (nitrogen and carbon) and detrital subsidies impact the ability of the belowground microbial community to alter the abundance of aboveground arthropods (herbivores and predators) associated with the intertidal cord grass Spartina alterniflora. We manipulated carbon, nitrogen, and detrital resources in a field experiment and measured decomposition rate, soil nitrogen pools, plant biomass and quality, herbivore density, and arthropod predator abundance. Because carbon subsidies impact plant growth only indirectly (microbial pathways), whereas nitrogen additions both directly (plant uptake) and indirectly (microbial pathways) impact plant primary productivity, we were able to assess the effect of both belowground soil microbes and nutrient availability on aboveground herbivores and their predators. Herbivore density in the field was suppressed by carbon supplements. Carbon addition altered soil microbial dynamics (net potential ammonification, litter decomposition rate, DON [dissolved organic N] concentration), which limited inorganic soil nitrogen availability and reduced plant size as well as predator abundance. Nitrogen addition enhanced herbivore density by increasing plant size and quality directly by increasing inorganic soil nitrogen pools, and indirectly by enhancing microbial nitrification. Detritus adversely affected aboveground herbivores mainly by promoting predator aggregation. To date, the effects of carbon and nitrogen subsidies on salt marshes have been examined as isolated effects on either the aboveground or the belowground community. Our results emphasize the importance of directly addressing the soil microbial community as a factor that influences aboveground food web structure by affecting plant size and aboveground plant nitrogen.},

However, in three years when the falcon eyrie was inactive (2007 to 2009), adult murres were depredated on the colony by Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and murre eggs were taken by Glaucous-winged Gulls (Larus glaucescens) after eagles flushed incubating murres. Consequently, breeding success in both species was low in 2007, then in 2008 and 2009 no murres bred successfully and no cor- morants built nests. That a single pair of falcons protected thousands of seabirds is noteworthy for its local conser- vation implications. Bottom-up control of seabird breeding success has been well documented, but there appears need for a better understanding of the role of top-down mechanisms as a result of both the direct (consumptive) and indirect (non-consumptive) effects of top predators.},

Here, we review the promises and challenges of these genome scan methods, including correcting for the confounding influence of a species' demographic history, biases caused by missing aspects of the genome, matching scales of environmental data with population structure, and other statistical considerations.

Maternal input is high when mothers feed on high densities of locally available migratory herbivores and low when mothers travel up to 70 km to forage. Using data from 19 cub cohorts on the incidence of siblicide (from monitoring the survival of 609 cubs in twin litters) and cub growth rates (from 195 cubs in twin litters) as a measure of maternal input, we demonstrate that the incidence of siblicide increased as average cohort growth rate declined. In total, there were 37 siblicides in 384 litters (9\% of litters). When both cubs were alive, total maternal input in siblicidal litters was significantly lower than in non- siblicidal litters and the mean share of the dominant sib of 64.6\% was significantly higher than the mean of 52.1\% for dominant sibs of non-siblicidal litters. After siblicide, growth rates of siblicide victors substantially increased, demonstrat- ing that mothers did not reduce maternal input after litter reduction. As a result, siblicide victors achieved a long-term growth rate similar to that of singletons and thus signifi- cantly increased their expected survival. We conclude that in spotted hyenas, high maternal input in lactation has favoured the evolution of facultative siblicide in populations inhabit- ing areas with low or fluctuating food resources.},

These freshwater populations have often evolved in similar ways from the ancestral marine stock from which they independently derived. With the exception of a few identified genes, the genetic basis of this remarkable parallel adaptation is unclear. Here we show that the parallel phenotypic evolution is matched by parallel patterns of nucleotide diversity and population differentiation across the genome. We used a novel high-throughput sequence-based genotyping approach to produce the first high density genome-wide scans of threespine stickleback populations and identified several genomic regions indicative of both divergent and balancing selection. Some of these regions have been associated previously with traits important for freshwater adaptation, but others were previously unidentified. Within these genomic regions we identified candidate genes, laying the foundation for further genetic and functional study of key pathways. This research illustrates the complementary nature of laboratory mapping, functional genetics, and population genomics.},

These functional responses express how the population growth rate of a mutualist is modified by the density of its partner. We present several possible dependencies of gross benefits and costs, and hence net effects, to a mutualist as functions of the density of its partner. Net effects to mutualists are likely a monotonically saturating or unimodal function of the density of their partner. We show that fundamental differences in the growth, limitation, and dynamics of a population can occur when net effects to that population change linearly, unimodally, or in a saturating fashion. We use the mutualism between senita cactus and its pollinating seed-eating moth as an example to show the influence of different benefit and cost functional responses on population dynamics and stability of mutualisms. We investigated two mechanisms that may alter this mutualism's functional responses: distribution of eggs among flowers and fruit abortion. Differences in how benefits and costs vary with density can alter the stability of this mutualism. In particular, fruit abortion may allow for a stable equilibrium where none could otherwise exist.},

It has often been shown that low reproductive success for birds in preferred habitat types was due to higher nest predator abundance. However, between-habitat differences in nest predation may only weakly correlate with differences in nest predator abundance. An ecological trap is at work in a farmland bird ( Lanius collurio ) that recently expanded its breeding habitat into open areas in plantation forests. This passerine bird shows a strong preference for forest habitat, but it has a higher nest success in farmland. We tested whether higher abundance of nest predators in the preferred habitat or, alternatively, a decoupling of nest predator abundance and nest predation explained this observed pattern of maladaptive habitat selection. More than 90\% of brood failures were attributed to nest predation. Nest predator abundance was more than 50\% higher in farmland, but nest predation was 17\% higher in forest. Differences between nest predation on actual shrike nests and on artificial nests suggested that parent shrikes may facilitate nest disclosure for predators in forest more than they do in farmland. The level of caution by parent shrikes when visiting their nest during a simulated nest predator intrusion was the same in the two habitats, but nest concealment was considerably lower in forest, which contributes to explaining the higher nest predation in this habitat. We conclude that a decoupling of nest predator abundance and nest predation may create ecological traps in human-modified environments.},

  abstract = {It is argued that alternate prey species in the diet of a food-limited predator should reduce each other's equilibria1 abundances, whether or not they directly compete. Such indirect, interspecific interactions are labeled apparent competition. Two examples arc discussed in which an observed pattern of habitat segregation was at first interpreted as evidence for direct competition, but later interpreted as apparent competition resulting from shared predation. In order to study the consequences of predator-mediated apparent competition in isolation from other complicating factors, a model community is analyzed in which there is no direct interspecific competition among the prey. An explicit necessary condition for prey species coexistence is derived for the case of one predator feeding on many prey species. This model community has several interesting properties: (1) Prey species with high relative values for a parameter r/a are ``keystone'' species in the community; (2) prey species can be excluded from the community by ``diffuse'' apparent competition; (3) large changes in the niche breadth of the predator need not correspond to large changes in predator density; (4) the prey trophic level as a whole is regulated by the predator, yet each of its constituent species is regulated by both the predator and available resources; (5) increased productivity may either increase, decrease, or leave unchanged the number of species in the community; (6) a decrease in density-independent mortality may decrease species diversity. The.e conclusions seem to be robust to changes in the prey growth equations and to the incorporation of predator satiation. By contrast, adding prey refugia or predator switching to the model weakens these conclusions. If the predator can be satiated or switched, the elements a\_ij comprising the community matrix may have signs opposite the long-term effect of j upon i. The effect of natural selection upon prey species coexistence is discussed. Unless r\_i, K\_i, and a\_i are tightly coupled, natural selection within prey species i will tend to decrease the equilibria1 abundance of species j.},

The fundamental niche is a mean phenotype of a population, a trait that can evolve by natural selection. In the analysis of the evolution of adaptations by natural selection one must specify the range of environments within which the relative fitnesses of alternative phenotypes are compared. Population dynamics automatically biases the environments experienced by an evolutionary lineage, simply because more individuals tend to be found within the fundamental niche than outside it (unless the population as a whole is going extinct). We argue that this basic asymmetry biases adaptive evolution toward further improvement to conditions inside the fundamental niche, even at the expense of fitness outside it. This suggests that natural selection may act principally as a conservative force on fundamental niches. We place the particular problem of the evolution of fundamental niches into the general framework of specifying the spatiotemporal scale for the analysis of adaptation in heterogeneous environments and introduce the notion of a 'phylogenetic envelope', a heuristic representation of this scaling. Because all of microevolution necessarily occurs within the constraint of the evolutionary dynamics of the fundamental niche, we conclude that understanding such dynamics should be of central concern to evolutionary ecologists. \textcopyright{} 1992 Chapmann \& Hall.},

  abstract = {G. Evelyn Hutchinson more than a half century ago proposed that one could characterize the ecological niche of a species as an abstract mapping of population dynamics onto an environmental space, the axes of which are abiotic and biotic factors that influence birth and death rates. If a habitat has conditions within a species' niche, a population should persist without immigration from external sources, whereas if conditions are outside the niche, it faces extinction. Analyses of species' niches are essential to understanding controls on species' geographical range limits and how these limits might shift in our rapidly changing world. Recent developments in ecology and evolutionary biology suggest it is time to revisit and refine Hutchinson's niche concept. After reviewing techniques for quantifying niches, I examine subtleties that arise because of impacts species have on their own environments, the density-dependent modulation of how individuals experience environments, and the interplay of dispersal and temporal heterogeneity in determining population persistence. Moreover, the evolutionary record over all time scales reveals a spectrum of rates of change in species' niches, from rapid niche evolution to profound niche conservatism. Substantial challenges revolving around the evolutionary dimension of the Hutchinsonian niche include quantifying the magnitude of evolved intraspecific and clade-level variation in niches and understanding the factors that govern where along the spectrum of potential evolutionary rates any given lineage lies. A growing body of theory provides elements of a conceptual framework for understanding niche conservatism and evolution, paving the way for an evolutionary theory of the niche.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Second-generation sequencing technologies are precipitating major shifts with regards to what kinds of genomes are being sequenced and how they are annotated. While the first generation of genome projects focused on well-studied model organisms, many of today's projects involve exotic organisms whose genomes are largely terra incognita. This complicates their annotation, because unlike first-generation projects, there are no pre-existing 'gold-standard' gene-models with which to train gene-finders. Improvements in genome assembly and the wide availability of mRNA-seq data are also creating opportunities to update and re-annotate previously published genome annotations. Today's genome projects are thus in need of new genome annotation tools that can meet the challenges and opportunities presented by second-generation sequencing technologies. RESULTS:We present MAKER2, a genome annotation and data management tool designed for second-generation genome projects. MAKER2 is a multi-threaded, parallelized application that can process second-generation datasets of virtually any size. We show that MAKER2 can produce accurate annotations for novel genomes where training-data are limited, of low quality or even non-existent. MAKER2 also provides an easy means to use mRNA-seq data to improve annotation quality; and it can use these data to update legacy annotations, significantly improving their quality. We also show that MAKER2 can evaluate the quality of genome annotations, and identify and prioritize problematic annotations for manual review. CONCLUSIONS:MAKER2 is the first annotation engine specifically designed for second-generation genome projects. MAKER2 scales to datasets of any size, requires little in the way of training data, and can use mRNA-seq data to improve annotation quality. It can also update and manage legacy genome annotation datasets.},

Here we show that performance costs that result from competing demands on one trait can be mitigated by compensatory changes in other traits, so long as performance has a complex basis. Numerical simulations indicate that increases in the number of traits that determine performance decrease the strength of performance trade-offs. In centrarchid fishes, multiple traits underlie suction feeding performance, and experimental data and hydrodynamic modeling show that combinations of traits evolve to increase the ability to feed on attached prey while mitigating costs to performance on evasive prey. Diet data for centrarchid species reveal a weak trade-off between these prey types, corroborating the results based on hydrodynamic modeling and suggesting that complexity in the functional basis of suction feeding performance enhances trophic diversification. Complexity may thus permit the evolution of combinations of high-performance behaviors that appear to violate underlying trade-offs, such as the ability to exert high suction forces with large gape. This phenomenon may promote morphological, functional, and ecological diversification in the face of the myriad selective demands organisms encounter.},

  abstract = {Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1) Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species, ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.},

However, the role that epistasis plays in the genetic architecture of quantitative traits is controversial.

We assessed allele frequency changes between pools of individuals at the extremes of the distribution for each trait in the Flyland population by deep DNA sequencing. The genetic architecture of all traits was highly polygenic in both analyses. Surprisingly, none of the SNPs associated with the traits in Flyland replicated in the DGRP and vice versa. However, the majority of these SNPs participated in at least one epistatic interaction in the DGRP. Despite apparent additive effects at largely distinct loci in the two populations, the epistatic interactions perturbed common, biologically plausible, and highly connected genetic networks. Our analysis underscores the importance of epistasis as a principal factor that determines variation for quantitative traits and provides a means to uncover genetic networks affecting these traits. Knowledge of epistatic networks will contribute to our understanding of the genetic basis of evolutionarily and clinically important traits and enhance predictive ability at an individualized level in medicine and agriculture.},

The organic C/N ratios and carbon and nitrogen isotopes suggested an autochthonous source of organic materials for the sed- iments of EPI (C/N = 10.21 {$\pm$} 0.28, n = 17; {$\delta$}13C = -13.48 {$\pm$} 0.50\textperthousand, {$\delta$}15N = 8.35 {$\pm$} 0.55\textperthousand, n = 4) and an allochthonous source of marine-derived organic materials for the sediments of PI (C/N = 6.15 {$\pm$} 0.08, {$\delta$}13C = -26.85 {$\pm$} 0.11\textperthousand, {$\delta$}15N = 21.21 {$\pm$} 2.02\textperthousand, n = 20). The concentrations of total phosphorus (TP), sele- nium (Se), mercury (Hg) and zinc (Zn) in PI sediments were much higher than those in EPI, the concentration of copper (Cu) in PI was a little lower, and the concentration of element lead (Pb) showed no difference. As mea- sured by the geoaccumulation indexes, Zn, TP, Hg and Se were from moderately to very strongly enriched in PI, relative to local mother rock, due to the guano input from juvenile emperor penguins. Because of its high tro- phic level and transfer efficiency, emperor penguin can transport a large amount of nutrients and contaminants from ocean to land even with a relatively small population, and its roles in the biogeochemical cycle between ocean and terrestrial environment should not be ignored.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:The technological revolution in next-generation sequencing has brought unprecedented opportunities to study any organism of interest at the genomic or transcriptomic level. Transcriptome assembly is a crucial first step for studying the molecular basis of phenotypes of interest using RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq). However, the optimal strategy for assembling vast amounts of short RNA-Seq reads remains unresolved, especially for organisms without a sequenced genome. This study compared four transcriptome assembly methods, including a widely used de novo assembler (Trinity), two transcriptome re-assembly strategies utilizing proteomic and genomic resources from closely related species (reference-based re-assembly and TransPS) and a genome-guided assembler (Cufflinks). RESULTS:These four assembly strategies were compared using a comprehensive transcriptomic database of Aedes albopictus, for which a genome sequence has recently been completed. The quality of the various assemblies was assessed by the number of contigs generated, contig length distribution, percent paired-end read mapping, and gene model representation via BLASTX. Our results reveal that de novo assembly generates a similar number of gene models relative to genome-guided assembly with a fragmented reference, but produces the highest level of redundancy and requires the most computational power. Using a closely related reference genome to guide transcriptome assembly can generate biased contig sequences. Increasing the number of reads used in the transcriptome assembly tends to increase the redundancy within the assembly and decrease both median contig length and percent identity between contigs and reference protein sequences. CONCLUSIONS:This study provides general guidance for transcriptome assembly of RNA-Seq data from organisms with or without a sequenced genome. The optimal transcriptome assembly strategy will depend upon the subsequent downstream analyses. However, our results emphasize the efficacy of de novo assembly, which can be as effective as genome-guided assembly when the reference genome assembly is fragmented. If a genome assembly and sufficient computational resources are available, it can be beneficial to combine de novo and genome-guided assemblies. Caution should be taken when using a closely related reference genome to guide transcriptome assembly. The quantity of read pairs used in the transcriptome assembly does not necessarily correlate with the quality of the assembly.},

  abstract = {Since the publication of the unified neutral theory in 2001, there has been much discussion of the theory, pro and con. The hypothesis of ecological equivalence is the fundamental yet controversial idea behind neutral theory. Assuming trophically similar species are demographically alike (symmetric) on a per capita basis is only an approximation, but it is equivalent to asking: How many of the patterns of ecological communities are the result of species similarities, rather than of species differences? The strategy behind neutral theory is to see how far one can get with the simplification of assuming ecological equivalence before introducing more complexity. In another paper, I review the empirical evidence that led me to hypothesize ecological equivalence among many of the tree species in the species-rich tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI). In this paper, I develop a simple model for the evolution of ecological equivalence or niche convergence, using as an example evolution of the suite of life history traits characteristic of shade tolerant tropical tree species. Although the model is simple, the conclusions from it seem likely to be robust. I conclude that ecological equivalence for resource use are likely to evolve easily and often, especially in species-rich communities that are dispersal and recruitment limited. In the case of the BCI forest, tree species are strongly dispersal- and recruitment-limited, not only because of restricted seed dispersal, but also because of low recruitment success due to heavy losses of the seedling stages to predators and pathogens and other abiotic stresses such as drought. These factors and the high species richness of the community strongly reduce the potential for competitive exclusion of functionally equivalent or nearly equivalent species. \textcopyright{} 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.},

  abstract = {This paper contains a new approach toward a theory of robust estimation; it treats in detail the asymptotic theory of estimating a location parameter for contaminated normal distributions, and exhibits estimators--intermediaries between sample mean and sample median--that are asymptotically most robust (in a sense to be specified) among all translation invariant estimators. For the general background, see Tukey (1960) (p. 448 ff.) Let x1, {$\cdots$}, xn be independent random variables with common distribution function F(t - {$\xi$}). The problem is to estimate the location parameter {$\xi$}, but with the complication that the prototype distribution F(t) is only approximately known. I shall primarily be concerned with the model of indeterminacy F = (1 - {$\epsilon$}){$\Phi$} + {$\epsilon$} H, where \$0 \textbackslash leqq \textbackslash epsilon {$<$} 1\$ is a known number, {$\Phi$}(t) = (2{$\pi$})-1/2 {$\int$}t -{$\infty$} exp(-1/2s2) ds is the standard normal cumulative and H is an unknown contaminating distribution. This model arises for instance if the observations are assumed to be normal with variance 1, but a fraction {$\epsilon$} of them is affected by gross errors. Later on, I shall also consider other models of indeterminacy, e.g., \$\textbackslash sup\_t |F(t) - \textbackslash Phi(t)| \textbackslash leqq \textbackslash epsilon\$. Some inconvenience is caused by the fact that location and scale parameters are not uniquely determined: in general, for fixed {$\epsilon$}, there will be several values of {$\xi$} and {$\sigma$} such that \$\textbackslash sup\_t|F(t) - \textbackslash Phi((t - \textbackslash xi)/\textbackslash sigma)| \textbackslash leqq \textbackslash epsilon\$, and similarly for the contaminated case. Although this inherent and unavoidable indeterminacy is small if {$\epsilon$} is small and is rather irrelevant for practical purposes, it poses awkward problems for the theory, especially for optimality questions. To remove this difficulty, one may either (i) restrict attention to symmetric distributions, and estimate the location of the center of symmetry (this works for {$\xi$} but not for {$\sigma$}); or (ii) one may define the parameter to be estimated in terms of the estimator itself, namely by its asymptotic value for sample size n \textrightarrow{} {$\infty$}; or (iii) one may define the parameters by arbitrarily chosen functionals of the distribution (e.g., by the expectation, or the median of F). All three possibilities have unsatisfactory aspects, and I shall usually choose the variant which is mathematically most convenient. It is interesting to look back to the very origin of the theory of estimation, namely to Gauss and his theory of least squares. Gauss was fully aware that his main reason for assuming an underlying normal distribution and a quadratic loss function was mathematical, i.e., computational, convenience. In later times, this was often forgotten, partly because of the central limit theorem. However, if one wants to be honest, the central limit theorem can at most explain why many distributions occurring in practice are approximately normal. The stress is on the word "approximately." This raises a question which could have been asked already by Gauss, but which was, as far as I know, only raised a few years ago (notably by Tukey): What happens if the true distribution deviates slightly from the assumed normal one? As is now well known, the sample mean then may have a catastrophically bad performance: seemingly quite mild deviations may already explode its variance. Tukey and others proposed several more robust substitutes--trimmed means, Winsorized means, etc.--and explored their performance for a few typical violations of normality. A general theory of robust estimation is still lacking; it is hoped that the present paper will furnish the first few steps toward such a theory. At the core of the method of least squares lies the idea to minimize the sum of the squared "errors," that is, to adjust the unknown parameters such that the sum of the squares of the differences between observed and computed values is minimized. In the simplest case, with which we are concerned here, namely the estimation of a location parameter, one has to minimize the expression {$\sum$}i (xi - T)2; this is of course achieved by the sample mean T = {$\sum$}i xi/n. I should like to emphasize that no loss function is involved here; I am only describing how the least squares estimator is defined, and neither the underlying family of distributions nor the true value of the parameter to be estimated enters so far. It is quite natural to ask whether one can obtain more robustness by minimizing another function of the errors than the sum of their squares. We shall therefore concentrate our attention to estimators that can be defined by a minimum principle of the form (for a location parameter): T = Tn(x1, {$\cdots$}, xn) minimizes {$\sum$}i {$\rho$}(xi - T), \textbackslash begin\{equation*\} \textbackslash tag\{M\} where \textbackslash rho is a non-constant function. \textbackslash end\{equation*\} Of course, this definition generalizes at once to more general least squares type problems, where several parameters have to be determined. This class of estimators contains in particular (i) the sample mean ({$\rho$}(t) = t2), (ii) the sample median ({$\rho$}(t) = |t|), and more generally, (iii) all maximum likelihood estimators ({$\rho$}(t) = -log f(t), where f is the assumed density of the untranslated distribution). These (M)-estimators, as I shall call them for short, have rather pleasant asymptotic properties; sufficient conditions for asymptotic normality and an explicit expression for their asymptotic variance will be given. How should one judge the robustness of an estimator Tn(x) = Tn(x1, {$\cdots$}, xn)? Since ill effects from contamination are mainly felt for large sample sizes, it seems that one should primarily optimize large sample robustness properties. Therefore, a convenient measure of robustness for asymptotically normal estimators seems to be the supremum of the asymptotic variance (n \textrightarrow{} {$\infty$}) when F ranges over some suitable set of underlying distributions, in particular over the set of all F = (1 - {$\epsilon$}){$\Phi$} + {$\epsilon$} H for fixed {$\epsilon$} and symmetric H. On second thought, it turns out that the asymptotic variance is not only easier to handle, but that even for moderate values of n it is a better measure of performance than the actual variance, because (i) the actual variance of an estimator depends very much on the behavior of the tails of H, and the supremum of the actual variance is infinite for any estimator whose value is always contained in the convex hull of the observations. (ii) If an estimator is asymptotically normal, then the important central part of its distribution and confidence intervals for moderate confidence levels can better be approximated in terms of the asymptotic variance than in terms of the actual variance. If we adopt this measure of robustness, and if we restrict attention to (M)-estimators, then it will be shown that the most robust estimator is uniquely determined and corresponds to the following {$\rho$}:{$\rho$}(t) = 1/2t2 for \$|t| {$<$} k, \textbackslash rho(t) = k|t| - \textbackslash frac\{1\}\{2\}k\^2\$ for |t| {$\geq$} k, with k depending on {$\epsilon$}. This estimator is most robust even among all translation invariant estimators. Sample mean (k = {$\infty$}) and sample median (k = 0) are limiting cases corresponding to {$\epsilon$} = 0 and {$\epsilon$} = 1, respectively, and the estimator is closely related and asymptotically equivalent to Winsorizing. I recall the definition of Winsorizing: assume that the observations have been ordered, x1 {$\leq$} x2 {$\leq$} {$\cdots$} {$\leq$} xn, then the statistic T = n-1(gxg + 1 + xg + 1 + xg + 2 + {$\cdots$} + xn - h + hxn - h) is called the Winsorized mean, obtained by Winsorizing the g leftmost and the h rightmost observations. The above most robust (M)-estimators can be described by the same formula, except that in the first and in the last summand, the factors xg + 1 and xn - h have to be replaced by some numbers u, v satisfying xg {$\leq$} u {$\leq$} xg + 1 and xn - h {$\leq$} v {$\leq$} xn - h + 1, respectively; g, h, u and v depend on the sample. In fact, this (M)-estimator is the maximum likelihood estimator corresponding to a unique least favorable distribution F0 with density f0(t) = (1 - {$\epsilon$})(2{$\pi$})-1/2e-{$\rho$}(t). This f0 behaves like a normal density for small t, like an exponential density for large t. At least for me, this was rather surprising--I would have expected an f0 with much heavier tails. This result is a particular case of a more general one that can be stated roughly as follows: Assume that F belongs to some convex set C of distribution functions. Then the most robust (M)-estimator for the set C coincides with the maximum likelihood estimator for the unique F0 {$\epsilon$} C which has the smallest Fisher information number I(F) = {$\int$} (f'/f)2f dt among all F {$\epsilon$} C. Miscellaneous related problems will also be treated: the case of non-symmetric contaminating distributions; the most robust estimator for the model of indeterminacy \$\textbackslash sup\_t|F(t) - \textbackslash Phi(t)| \textbackslash leqq \textbackslash epsilon\$; robust estimation of a scale parameter; how to estimate location, if scale and {$\epsilon$} are unknown; numerical computation of the estimators; more general estimators, e.g., minimizing \$\textbackslash sum\_\{i {$<$} j\} \textbackslash rho(x\_i - T, x\_j - T)\$, where {$\rho$} is a function of two arguments. Questions of small sample size theory will not be touched in this paper.},

This work estimates the number of populations per area of a sample of species from literature on population differentiation and the average range area of a species from a sample of distribution maps. This yields an estimate of about 220 populations per species, or 1.1 to 6.6 billion populations globally. Assuming that population extinction is a linear function of habitat loss, approximately 1800 populations per hour (16 million annually) are being destroyed in tropical forests alone.},

  abstract = {Motivated by recent global reductions in biodiversity, empirical and theoretical research suggests that more species-rich systems exhibit enhanced productivity, nutrient cycling, or resistance to disturbance or invasion relative to systems with fewer species. In contrast, few data are available to assess the potential ecosystem-level importance of genetic diversity within species known to play a major functional role. Using a manipulative field experiment, we show that increasing genotypic diversity in a habitat-forming species (the seagrass Zostera marina) enhances community resistance to disturbance by grazing geese. The time required for recovery to near predisturbance densities also decreases with increasing eelgrass genotypic diversity. However, there is no effect of diversity on resilience, measured as the rate of shoot recovery after the disturbance, suggesting that more rapid recovery in diverse plots is due solely to differences in disturbance resistance. Genotypic diversity did not affect ecosystem processes in the absence of disturbance. Thus, our results suggest that genetic diversity, like species diversity, may be most important for enhancing the consistency and reliability of ecosystems by providing biological insurance against environmental change.},

  abstract = {Understanding the ecological consequences of biodiversity is a fundamental challenge. Research on a key component of biodiversity, genetic diversity, has traditionally focused on its importance in evolutionary processes, but classical studies in evolutionary biology, agronomy and conservation biology indicate that genetic diversity might also have important ecological effects. Our review of the literature reveals significant effects of genetic diversity on ecological processes such as primary productivity, population recovery from disturbance, interspecific competition, community structure, and fluxes of energy and nutrients. Thus, genetic diversity can have important ecological consequences at the population, community and ecosystem levels, and in some cases the effects are comparable in magnitude to the effects of species diversity. However, it is not clear how widely these results apply in nature, as studies to date have been biased towards manipulations of plant clonal diversity, and little is known about the relative importance of genetic diversity vs. other factors that influence ecological processes of interest. Future studies should focus not only on documenting the presence of genetic diversity effects but also on identifying underlying mechanisms and predicting when such effects are likely to occur in nature.},

  abstract = {The human Y chromosome began to evolve from an autosome hundreds of millions of years ago, acquiring a sex-determining function and undergoing a series of inversions that suppressed crossing over with the X chromosome1,2. Little is known about the recent evolution of the Y chromosome because only the human Y chromosome has been fully sequenced. Prevailing theories hold that Y chromosomes evolve by gene loss, the pace of which slows over time, eventually leading to a paucity of genes, and stasis3,4. These theories have been buttressed by partial sequence data from newly emergent plant and animal Y chromosomes5\textendash 8, but they have not been tested in older, highly evolved Y chromosomes such as that of humans. Here we finished sequencing of the male-specific region of the Y chromosome (MSY) in our closest living relative, the chimpanzee, achieving levels of accuracy and completion previ- ously reached for the human MSY. By comparing the MSYs of the two species we show that they differ radically in sequence structure and gene content, indicating rapid evolution during the past 6million years. The chimpanzee MSY contains twice as many massive palindromes as the human MSY, yet it has lost large frac- tions of the MSY protein-coding genes and gene families present in the last common ancestor. We suggest that the extraordinary diver- gence of the chimpanzee and human MSYs was driven by four synergistic factors: the prominent role of the MSY in sperm pro- duction, `genetic hitchhiking' effects in the absence of meiotic crossing over, frequent ectopic recombination within the MSY, and species differences in mating behaviour. Although genetic decay may be the principal dynamic in the evolution of newly emergent Y chromosomes, wholesale renovation is the paramount theme in the continuing evolution of chimpanzee, human and perhaps other older MSYs.},

The human MSY (male-specific region of Y chromosome) retains only three percent of the ancestral autosomes' genes owing to genetic decay4,5. This evolutionary decay was driven by a series of five `stratification' events. Each event suppressed X\textendash Y crossing over within a chro- mosome segment or `stratum', incorporated that segment into the MSY and subjected its genes to the erosive forces that attend the absence of crossing over2,6. The last of these events occurred 30 million years ago, 5 million years before the human and Old World monkey lineages diverged. Although speculation abounds regarding ongoing decay and looming extinction of the human Y chromosome7\textendash 10, remarkably little is known about how many MSY genes were lost in the human lineage in the 25 million years that have followed its separation from the Old World monkey lineage. To investigate this question, we sequenced the MSY of the rhesus macaque, an Old World monkey, and compared it to the human MSY. We discovered that during the last 25 million years MSY gene loss in the human lineage was limited to the youngest stratum (stratum 5), which comprises three percent of the human MSY. In the older strata, which collectively comprise the bulk of the human MSY, gene loss evidently ceased more than 25 million years ago. Likewise, the rhesus MSY has not lost any older genes (from strata 1\textendash 4) during the past 25 million years, despite its major structural differences to the human MSY. The rhesus MSY is simpler, with few amplified gene families or palindromes that might enable intrachromosomal recombination and repair. We present an empirical reconstruction of human MSY evolution in which each stratum transitioned from rapid, exponential loss of ancestral genes to strict conservation through purifying selection.},

  abstract = {The concept of basal metabolic rate (BMR) was developed to compare the metabolic rate of animals and initially was important in a clinical context as a means of determining thyroid status of humans. It was also important in defining the allometric relationship between body mass and metabolic rate of mammals. The BMR of mammals varies with body mass, with the same allometric exponent as field metabolic rate and with many physiological and biochemical rates. The membrane pacemaker theory proposes that the fatty acid composition of membrane bilayers is an important determinant of a species BMR. In both mammals and birds, membrane polyunsaturation decreases and monounsaturation increases with increasing body mass and a decrease in mass-specific BMR. The secretion and production of thyroid hormones in mammals are related to body mass, with the allometric exponent similar to BMR; yet there is no body size-related variation in either total or free concentrations of thyroid hormones in plasma of mammals. It is suggested that in different-sized mammals, the secretion/production of thyroid hormones is a result of BMR differences rather than their cause. BMR is a useful concept in some situations but not in others.},

  abstract = {Humans have traded and transported alien species for millennia with two notable step-changes: the end of the Middle Ages and beginning of the Industrial Revolution. However, in recent decades the world has entered a new phase in the magnitude and diversity of biological invasions: the Era of Globalization. This Special Profile reviews the links between the main drivers of globalization and biological invasions and examines state-of-the-art approaches to pathway risk assessment to illustrate new opportunities for managing invasive species. Income growth is a primary driver of globalization and a clear association exists between Gross Domestic Product and the richness of alien floras and faunas for many regions of the world. In many cases, the exposure of these economies to trade is highlighted by the significant role of merchandise imports in biological invasions, especially for island ecosystems. Post-1950, technical and logistic improvements have accelerated the ease with which commodities are transported across the globe and hindered the traceability of goods and the ease of intercepting pests. New sea, land and air links in international trade and human transport have established novel pathways for the spread of alien species. Increasingly, the science advances underpinning invasive species management must move at the speed of commerce. Increasing transport networks and demand for commodities have led to pathway risk assessments becoming the frontline in the prevention of biological invasions. The diverse routes of introduction arising from contaminant, stowaway, corridor and unaided pathways, in both aquatic and terrestrial biomes are complex. Nevertheless, common features enable comparable approaches to risk assessment. By bringing together spatial data on climate suitability, habitat availability and points of entry, as well a demographic models that include species dispersal (both natural and human-mediated) and measures of propagule pressure, it is possible to generate risk maps highlighting potential invasion hotspots that can inform prevention strategies. Synthesis and applications. To date, most attempts to model pathways have focused on describing the likelihood of invader establishment. Few have modelled explicit management strategies such as optimal detection and inspection strategies and assessments of the effectiveness of different management measures. A future focus in these areas will ensure research informs response.},

These tradeoffs have profound implications in agriculture and natural ecosystems, as both processes are vital for plant survival, reproduction, and, ultimately, plant fitness. While many of the molecular mechanisms underlying growth and defense tradeoffs remain to be elucidated, hormone crosstalk has emerged as a major player in regulating tradeoffs needed to achieve a balance. In this review, we cover recent advances in understanding growth\textendash defense tradeoffs in plants as well as what is known regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms. Specifically, we address evidence supporting the growth\textendash defense tradeoff concept, as well as known interactions between defense signaling and growth signaling. Understanding the molecular basis of these tradeoffs in plants should provide a foundation for the development of breeding strategies that optimize the growth\textendash defense balance to maximize crop yield to meet rising global food and biofuel demands.},

  abstract = {A model is presented for two insect species whose larvae compete on discrete and ephemeral patches of food resource. At the beginning of every generation, eggs from both species are distributed among the patches according to a bivariate negative binomial distribution. This allows one to study the effects of covariance between the distributions of the two species. Results include: (1) Coexistence of competitors is facilitated whenever aggregation within species is greater than aggregation between species. This extends the results obtained by Atkinson \& Shorrocks (1981); J. Anim. Ecol. 50, 461) and Ives \& May (1985); J. theor. Biol. 115, 65), who considered only the special case when species are distributed independently of each other. (2) Increasing covariance between two species makes coexistence more difficult. However, increased covariance can never make coexistence more difficult than when the individuals from both species are homogeneously distributed among patches. Most models in the literature assume a homogeneous distribution, and therefore they represent the worst case for coexistence. (3) When two species coexist, covariance will affect both equilibrium population densities and population dynamics. With greater positive covariance, the reduction in the population growth rate of a species when perturbed to low densities is greater than the reduction in equilibrium population densities. Therefore, covariance may cause a dynamical fragility, as species are less able to rebound if they approach extinction. However, this fragility is not necessarily reflected by long-term population densities, which may remain little changed by covariance. These three results emphasize that in order to understand population-level interactions, the behavior of female insects searching for oviposition sites must be examined. \textcopyright{} 1988 Academic Press Limited.},

We then show how to use estimates of phylogenetic signals to predict novel consumer-resource associations solely from the phylogenetic position of species for which no other (or only partial) data are available. Finally, we show how to combine phylogenetic information with information about species' ecological characteristics and life-history traits to estimate the effects of species traits on consumer-resource associations while accounting for phylogenies.

A growing number of empirical studies demonstrate positive diversity-stability relationships. These studies, however, have emphasized only a few types of stability, and they rarely uncover the mechanisms responsible for stability. Because anthropogenic changes often affect stability and diversity simultaneously, diversity-stability relationships cannot be understood outside the context of the environmental drivers affecting both. This shifts attention away from diversity-stability relationships toward the multiple factors, including diversity, that dictate the stability of ecosystems.},

Here, we use locally linear, autoregressive state-space models to statistically identify nonlinear processes that govern the dynamics of time series. We develop both time-varying and threshold models. In time-varying autoregressive models with p time lags, AR( p), and vector autoregressive models for n-dimensional systems of order p{$\frac{1}{4}$}1, VAR(1), we assume that coefficients vary with time. We can infer an approaching regime shift if the coefficients indicate critical slowing down of the local dynamics of the system. In self- excited threshold models, we assume that the time series is governed by two autoregressive processes; the state variable switches between them when the time series crosses a threshold value.We use the existence of a statistically significant threshold as an indicator of alternative stable states. All models are fit to data using a state-space form that incorporates measurement error, and maximum likelihood estimation allows for statistically testing alternative hypotheses about the processes governing dynamics. Our model-based approach for forecasting regime shifts and identifying alternative stable states overcomes limitations of other common metric-based approaches and is a useful addition to the toolbox of methods for analyzing nonlinear time series.},

Consistent with ecological\textendash evolutionary dynamics, the resistant aphid populations then had reduced parasitism and increased population growth rates. We fit a model to quantify costs (reduced intrinsic rates of increase) and benefits of resistance. We also performed genetic assays on 5 years of field samples that showed persistent but highly variable frequencies of aphid clones containing protective symbionts; these patterns were consistent with simulations from the model.

A model based on the power curve best describes growth of Everglades alligators. The nonasymptotic character of this curve leads to rejection of the hypothesis that alligator growth is determinate. A model consisting of piece-wise linear equations better described growth in the first year, and suggested a period of arrested growth occurred in the first winter. A comparison of predictions from growth models derived from several populations indicated that Everglades alligators grew more slowly than did those in more temperate areas, leading to the rejection of the hypothesis that growth rates in subtropical Florida would be elevated because of the long growing season. We attribute this result to a combination of increased maintenance costs and a limited resource base in the Everglades. Analyses considered the extent to which growth model evaluation and use can be affected by data selection. Mathematical constraints posed by negative growth data can be alleviated by including growth records over combined recapture intervals to achieve a positive growth increment. However, periods of no to negative growth may be real, and such deviations are obscured by fitting growth data to monotonically increasing models.},

Yet, the influence of most types of interspecific interactions on adaptive evolutionary diversification remains poorly understood. In particular, the role of mutualistic interactions in shaping adaptive radiations has been largely unexplored, despite the ubiquity of mutualisms and increasing evidence of their ecological and evolutionary importance. Our aim here is to encourage empirical inquiry into the relationship between mutualism and evolutionary diversification, using herbivorous insects and their microbial mutualists as exemplars. Phytophagous insects have long been used to test theories of evolutionary diversification; moreover, the diversification of a number of phytophagous insect lineages has been linked to mutualisms with microbes. In this perspective, we examine microbial mutualist mediation of ecological opportunity and ecologically based divergent natural selection for their insect hosts. We also explore the conditions and mechanisms by which microbial mutualists may either facilitate or impede adaptive evolutionary diversification. These include effects on the availability of novel host plants or adaptive zones, modifying host-associated fitness trade-offs during host shifts, creating or reducing enemy-free space, and, overall, shaping the evolution of ecological (host plant) specialization. Although the conceptual framework presented here is built on phytophagous insect-microbe mutualisms, many of the processes and predictions are broadly applicable to other mutualisms in which host ecology is altered by mutualistic interactions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Plant-feeding insects make up a large part of earth's total biodiversity. While it has been shown that herbivory has repeatedly led to increased diversification rates in insects, there has been no compelling explanation for how plant-feeding has promoted speciation rates. There is a growing awareness that ecological factors can lead to rapid diversification and, as one of the most prominent features of most insect-plant interactions, specialization onto a diverse resource has often been assumed to be the main process behind this diversification. However, specialization is mainly a pruning process, and is not able to actually generate diversity by itself. Here we investigate the role of host colonizations in generating insect diversity, by testing if insect speciation rate is correlated with resource diversity. RESULTS:By applying a variant of independent contrast analysis, specially tailored for use on questions of species richness (MacroCAIC), we show that species richness is strongly correlated with diversity of host use in the butterfly family Nymphalidae. Furthermore, by comparing the results from reciprocal sister group selection, where sister groups were selected either on the basis of diversity of host use or species richness, we find that it is likely that diversity of host use is driving species richness, rather than vice versa. CONCLUSION:We conclude that resource diversity is correlated with species richness in the Nymphalidae and suggest a scenario based on recurring oscillations between host expansions - the incorporation of new plants into the repertoire - and specialization, as an important driving force behind the diversification of plant-feeding insects.},

  abstract = {Microbiologists have long recognized the importance of horizontal gene transfer\textemdash the movement of genetic material between organisms\textemdash in adaptation. It is common for plasmids (rings of DNA that are separate from chromosomal DNA) and phage (viruses that infect bacteria) to move between bacterial species, and their movement is often accompanied by the transfer of traits, such as antibiotic resistance, that are of great adaptive importance. In contrast, in multicellular organisms, the mutational variation upon which natural selection acts is generated independently within each species. It has recently become clear, however, that horizontal transfer of traits can play a major role in arthropod evolution. Studies of insects have detailed cases in which traits under selection are encoded by a bacterial symbiont. These microbes are commonly maternally inherited within species and therefore provide variation that is accessible for the process of natural selection. Like plasmids, however, symbiotic bacteria also occasionally move to a different host species. On page 254 of this issue, Himler et al. ( 1 ) present just such a case study. It documents fast evolution after the introduction of a new symbiont into a population of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci . They detail the spread of a Rickettsia bacterial symbiont that, in just 6 years, dramatically increased the survival and fecundity of its host in the southwestern United States.},

We tested this hypothesis in a field experiment by manipulating patches of Evening Primrose (Oenothera biennis) to contain one, four or eight plant genotypes. We then surveyed 92 species of naturally colonizing arthropods. Generically diverse plant patches had 18\% more arthropod species, and a greater abundance of omnivorous and predacious arthropods, but not herbivores, compared with monocultures. The effects of genotypic diversity on arthropod communities were due to a combination of interactive and additive effects among genotypes within genetically diverse patches. Greater genetic diversity also led to a selective feedback, as mean genotype fitness was 27\% higher in diverse patches than in monocultures. A comparison between our results and the literature reveals that genetic diversity and species diversity can have similar qualitative and quantitative effects on arthropod communities. Our findings also illustrate the benefit of preserving genetic variation to conserve species diversity and interactions within multitrophic communities.},

Brackish water (480 mosm kg-1) orfresh tap water wasprovided to the birds on an ad lib. basis. Nestlings maintained on the unaltered-crayfish diet gained mass at rates similar to those ofparent-reared nestlings. Birds on thefiddler-crab and salt-loaded crayfish diets lost approximately 3\% of their body massper day until fresh water was substitutedfor brackish water 7 d into the experiment. Nestling hematocrits, serum osmolality, and serum electrolyte levels indicated that during thefirst week of the experiment, nestlings on the two high-salt diets were dehydrated and salt loaded. Thisoccurred even though birds on high-salt diets exhibited hyper- trophic development of their salt glands. When birds on the high-salt diets were al- lowed to drink fresh water, all began gaining mass within 2 d, and their serum osmolality and salt returned to levels similar to those of nestlings on the low-salt diet. Our experiments indicate that a physiological constraint acting on nestling ibis is responsible for thefact that ibis breeding in coastal colonies fly long distances inland to secure freshwaterpreyfor their young.},

  abstract = {Pacific Northwest great blue herons (Ardea herodias fannini) appear to have modified nesting behaviour in response to the strong recent recovery of the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) population. Previously undescribed, herons now often nest in close association with some breeding eagles, even though eagles depredate heron nestlings, are implicated in the recent reproductive decline of herons, and may induce abandonment of heron breeding colonies. I tested the hypothesis that breeding herons gain protection from the territorial behaviour of eagles. Natural observations and simulated incursions showed that nesting eagles actively repel other eagles within at least 250m around the nest site, thereby establishing a relatively safe place for herons to nest. Surveys showed that 70\% of heron nests and 19\% of heron colonies were located within 200 metres of eagle nests with high reproductive success. These herons had greater reproductive success than those nesting far from eagle nests.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}A key goal of invasion biology is to identify the factors that favor species invasions. One potential indicator of invasiveness is the phylogenetic distance between a nonnative species and species in the recipient community. However, predicting invasiveness using phylogenetic information relies on an untested assumption: that both biotic resistance and facilitation weaken with increasing phylogenetic distance. We test the validity of this key assumption using a mathematical model in which a novel species is introduced into communities with varying ecological and phylogenetic relationships. Contrary to what is generally assumed, we find that biotic resistance and facilitation can either weaken or intensify with phylogenetic distance, depending on the mode of interspecific interactions (phenotype matching or phenotype differences) and the resulting evolutionary trajectory of the recipient community. Thus, we demonstrate that considering the mechanisms that drive phenotypic divergence between native and nonnative species can provide critical insight into the relationship between phylogenetic distance and invasibility.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Rice plants significantly increased Beggiatoa survival in flooded soils. Some hydrogen sulfide was necessary for survival of the Bernard clay isolate; high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide killed the Bernard clay isolate but were tolerated by a Crowley silt loam isolate from Eagle Lake, Texas.

Natural variants resulting in differently timed behaviour or physiology, known as chronotypes in humans, have not been well characterized at the molecular level. We sequenced the genome of Clunio marinus, a marine midge whose reproduction is timed by circadian and circalunar clocks. Midges from different locations show strain-specific genetic timing adaptations. We examined genetic variation in five C. marinus strains from different locations and mapped quantitative trait loci for circalunar and circadian chronotypes. The region most strongly associated with circadian chronotypes generates strain-specific differences in the abundance of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II.1 (CaMKII.1) splice variants. As equivalent variants were shown to alter CaMKII activity in Drosophila melanogaster, and C. marinus (Cma)-CaMKII.1 increases the transcriptional activity of the dimer of the circadian proteins Cma-CLOCK and Cma-CYCLE, we suggest that modulation of alternative splicing is a mechanism for natural adaptation in circadian timing.},

Although data are ever more plentiful and powerful analysis methods are available, there remain many challenges to reliable tree building. Here, we discuss the major steps of phylogenetic analysis, including identification of orthologous genes or proteins, multiple sequence alignment, and choice of substitution models and inference methodologies.

Here we address these issues by developing a bioinformatics pipeline that maps pooled sequencing (Pool-Seq) reads from D. melanogaster to a hologenome consisting of fly and symbiont genomes and estimates allele frequencies using either a heuristic (PoolSNP) or a probabilistic variant caller (SNAPE-pooled). We use this pipeline to generate the largest data repository of genomic data available for D. melanogaster to date, encompassing 271 previously published and unpublished population samples from over 100 locations in {$>$}20 countries on four continents. Several of these locations have been sampled at different seasons across multiple years. This data set, which we call Drosophila Evolution over Space and Time (DEST), is coupled with sampling and environmental metadata. A web-based genome browser and web portal provide easy access to the SNP data set. We further provide guidelines on how to use Pool-Seq data for model-based demographic inference. Our aim is to provide this scalable platform as a community resource which can be easily extended via future efforts for an even more extensive cosmopolitan data set. Our resource will enable population geneticists to analyze spatiotemporal genetic patterns and evolutionary dynamics of D. melanogaster populations in unprecedented detail.},

Plasma T4 ranged from 0.16 to 4.63 ng/ml and T, from 0 to 1.76 ng/ml during the course of the year. Peaks of T4 and T3 could be related with prehibernating (October/November) and posthibernating (March/April) periods, when scale shedding and O2 consumption were also enhanced. Maximum abdominal fat deposition was found in prehibernatory months (October/November). Thyroid hormone levels declined sharply with entry into hibernation. Abdominal fat deposits gradually decreased, being almost depleted by the end of hibernation. The gradual increase in thyroid hormone concentration in the later half of hibernation may be associated with increased lipolysis and preparation of the oncoming reproductive period. Although T4 and T3 profiles were apparently parallel, discrepancies were observed. Posthibernatory peak of T4 was maintained much longer than that of T3 which declined earlier. Also the rise in the prehibernatory T3 concentration was delayed as compared to that in T4.},

The ecological impacts of such perturbations are often contingent on abiotic conditions, which have hindered efforts to generalize the results of field experiments. Thus, there is a need for experiments that selectively remove different species from ecologically important guilds and that are replicated across environmental gradients. In 2008, we constructed a series of size-selective large-herbivore exclosures across a natural rainfall gradient in semi-arid Kenyan savanna. This experiment (``UHURU'', for ungulate herbivory under rainfall uncertainty) aims to (a) characterize the effects of successively removing the largest size classes of herbivores from the system and (b) evaluate how the direction and magnitude of these effects are shaped by variation in precipitation regimes. UHURU consists of thre...},

  abstract = {Organisms can respond to fluctuating environments by phenotypic plasticity and rapid evolution, both occurring on similar timescales to the environmental fluctuations. Because each adaptation mechanism has been independently studied, the effects of different adaptation mechanisms on ecological dynamics are not well understood. Here, using mathematical modeling, we compared the advantages of phenotypic plasticity and rapid evolution under conditions where the environment fluctuated between two states on various timescales. The results indicate that the advantages of phenotypic plasticity under environmental fluctuations on different timescales depend on the cost and the speed of plasticity. Both the speed of plastic adaptation and the cost of plasticity affect competition results, while the quantitative effects of them vary depending on the timescales. When the environment fluctuates on short timescales, the two populations with evolution and plasticity coexist, although the population with evolution is dominant. On moderate timescales, the two populations also coexist; however, the population with plasticity becomes dominant. On long timescales, whether the population with phenotypic plasticity or evolution is more advantageous depended on the cost of plasticity. Moreover, our results indicate that the mechanisms resulting in the dominance of the plastic population over the population with evolution are different depending on the timescales of environmental fluctuations. Therefore, the timescales of environmental fluctuations deserve more attention if we are to better understand the detailed competition results underlying phenotypic variation.},

To evaluate this hypothesis, I review the literature on selection experiments in heterogeneous environments. The niche width usually - but not invariably - evolves to match the amount of environmental variation, specialists evolving in homogeneous environments and generalists evolving in heterogeneous environments. The genetics of niche width are more complex than has previously been recognized, particularly with respect to the magnitude of costs of adaptation and the putative constraints on the evolution of generalists. Genetic variation in fitness is more readily maintained in heterogeneous environments than in homogeneous environments and this diversity is often stably maintained through negative frequency-dependent selection. Moreover environmental heterogeneity appears to be a plausible mechanism for at least two well-known patterns of species diversity at the landscape scale. I conclude that environmental heterogeneity is a plausible and possibly very general explanation for diversity across the range of scales from individuals to landscapes.},

They are a paradigm for testing evolutionary hypotheses about traits favoured by particular environmental factors. This paper is an attempt to summarize the conceptual framework for local adaptation studies. We first review theoretical work relevant for local adaptation. Then we discuss reciprocal transplant and common garden experiments designed to detect local adaptation in the pattern of deme x habitat interaction for fitness. Finally, we review research questions and approaches to studying the processes of local adaptation - divergent natural selection, dispersal and gene flow, and other processes affecting adaptive differentiation of local demes. We advocate multifaceted approaches to the study of local adaptation, and stress the need for experiments explicitly addressing hypotheses about the role of particular ecological and genetic factors that promote or hinder local adaptation. Experimental evolution of replicated populations in controlled spatially heterogeneous environments allow direct tests of such hypotheses, and thus would be a valuable way to complement research on natural populations.},

Host protection evolved in all six, independently selected populations in response to within-host bacterial interactions and without direct selection for host health. Microbe-mediated protection was also effective against a broad spectrum of pathogenic S. aureus isolates. Genomic analysis implied that the mechanistic basis for E. faecalis-mediated protection was through increased production of antimicrobial superoxide, which was confirmed by biochemical assays. Our results indicate that microbes living within a host may make the evolutionary transition to mutualism in response to pathogen attack, and that microbiome evolution warrants consideration as a driver of infection outcome.},

We reviewed the literature from 1984 through 1997 for studies that estimated the strength of linear and quadratic selection in terms of standardized selection gradients or differentials on natural variation in quantitative traits for field populations. We tabulated 63 published studies of 62 species that reported over 2,500 estimates of linear or quadratic selection. More than 80\% of the estimates were for morphological traits; there is very little data for behavioral or physiological traits. Most published selection studies were unreplicated and had sample sizes below 135 individuals, resulting in low statistical power to detect selection of the magnitude typically reported for natural populations. The absolute values of linear selection gradients \textbackslash beta\textbackslash{} were exponentially distributed with an overall median of 0.16, suggesting that strong directional selection was uncommon. The values of \textbackslash beta\textbackslash{} for selection on morphological and on life- history/ phenological traits were significantly different: on average, selection on morphology was stronger than selection on phenology/ life history. Similarly, the values of \textbackslash beta\textbackslash{} for selection via aspects of survival, fecundity, and mating success were significantly different: on average, selection on mating success was stronger than on survival. Comparisons of estimated linear selection gradients and differentials suggest that indirect components of phenotypic selection were usually modest relative to direct components. The absolute values of quadratic selection gradients \textbackslash gamma\textbackslash{} were exponentially distributed with an overall median of only 0.10, suggesting that quadratic selection is typically quite weak. The distribution of gamma values was symmetric about 0, providing no evidence that stabilizing selection is stronger or more common than disruptive selection in nature.},

These interactions challenge our inclinations and training to seek the simplest explanations of patterns in nature. Not least is the likelihood that some complex processes might be missed when their patterns look similar to predictions for simpler mechanisms. Along these lines, theory and empirical evidence increasingly suggest that environmental, ecological, phenotypic, and genetic processes can be tightly intertwined, resulting in complex and sometimes surprising eco-evolutionary dynamics. The goal of this review is to temper inclinations to unquestioningly seek the simplest explanations in ecology and evolution, by recognizing that some eco-evolutionary outcomes may appear very similar to purely ecological, purely evolutionary, or even null expectations, and thus be cryptic. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for observational biases and mechanisms that might operate among the various links in eco-evolutionary feedbacks to produce cryptic patterns. Recognition that cryptic dynamics can be associated with outcomes like stability, resilience, recovery, or coexistence in a dynamically changing world provides added impetus for finding ways to study them.},

This class of models assumes that there is an inverse relationship between competitive ability and colonization ability and that competitively superior species exclude competitively inferior species when both occupy the same site. This hierarchical model of performance trade-offs, however, exhibits some unusual behaviors in the high-diversity limit, including infinitesimally close species packing, pathologically slow dynamics, and fundamentally important regularities in trait-abundance relationships. In particular, under the condition of constant mortality across species, a 3/2-power-law relationship emerges between abundance and fecundity under infinite packing (abundance of a species with fecundity f is inversely proportional to f to the 3/2 power). In this article, we explore the high-diversity limit of the hierarchical competition-colonization model, with particular emphasis on patterns of species packing, species-abundance relationships, and system stability. Because of the potential for pathologically slow dynamics following perturbations and infinitesimally close species packing in the high-diversity limit for this class of models, the models may need to be modified to include more realistic mechanisms governing the extent and timing of interspecific competitive exclusion in order to effectively capture the structure and dynamics of real-world ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Environments change, for both natural and anthropogenic reasons, which can threaten species persistence. Evolutionary adaptation is a potentially powerful mechanism to allow species to persist in these changing environments. To determine the conditions under which adaptation will prevent extinction (evolutionary rescue), classic quantitative genetics models have assumed a constantly changing environment. They predict that species traits will track a moving environmental optimum with a lag that approaches a constant. If fitness is negative at this lag, the species will go extinct. There have been many elaborations of these models incorporating increased genetic realism. Here, we review and explore the consequences of four ecological complications: Non-quadratic fitness functions, interacting density- A nd trait-dependence, species interactions and fundamental limits to adaptation. We show that non-quadratic fitness functions can result in evolutionary tipping points and existential crises, as can the interaction between density- A nd trait-dependent mortality. We then review the literature on how interspecific interactions affect adaptation and persistence. Finally, we suggest an alternative theoretical framework that considers bounded environmental change and fundamental limits to adaptation. A research programme that combines theory and experiments and integrates across organizational scales will be needed to predict whether adaptation will prevent species extinction in changing environments.

Continual variation of the P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein (PfEMP1) antigens displayed on the surface of infected red blood cells enables the parasite to evade the immune system and prolong infection. Despite the importance of antigenic variation in generating the dynamics of infection, our understanding of the mechanisms by which antigenic variation generates long-term chronic infections is still limited. We developed a model to examine the role of cross-reactivity in generating infection dynamics that are comparable to those of experimental infections. The hybrid computational model we developed is attuned to the biology of malaria by mixing discrete replication events, which mimics the synchrony of parasite replication and invasion, with continuous interaction with the immune system. Using simulations, we evaluated the dynamics of a single malaria infection over time. We then examined three major mechanisms by which the dynamics of a malaria infection can be structured: cross-reactivity of the immune response to PfEMP1, differences in parasite clearance rates, and heterogeneity in the rate at which antigens switch. The results of our simulations demonstrate that cross-reactive immune responses play a primary role in generating the dynamics observed in experimentally untreated infections and in lengthening the period of infection. Importantly, we also find that it is the primary response to the initially expressed PfEMP1, or small subset thereof, that structures the cascading cross-immune dynamics and allows for elongation of the infection.},

R is an open-source programming language that is widely used by statisticians and is seeing enormous growth in its application to data in all fields. It is interactive, containing many powerful facilities for optimization, model evaluation, model selection, and graphical display of data. The reader who fits data in R can readily make use of these methods. The researcher who uses R to fit and model his data has access to most recently developed statistical methods. This book does not assume that the reader is familiar with R, and a little experience with any programming language is all that is needed to appreciate this book. There are large numbers of examples of R in the text and the source code for all examples is available in an R package MPDiR available through R. Kenneth Knoblauch is a researcher in the Department of Integrative Neurosciences in Inserm Unit 846, The Stem Cell and Brain Research Institute and associated with the University Claude Bernard, Lyon 1, in France. Laurence T. Maloney is Professor of Psychology and Neural Science at New York University. His research focusses on applications of mathematical models to perception, motor control and decision making"--Back cover.},

  abstract = {During community assembly, species accumulate by both immigration and in situ diversification. Diversification has intrigued biologists because its extent varies even among closely related lineages under similar ecological conditions. Recent research has suggested that some of this puzzling variation may be caused by stochastic differences in the history of immigration (relative timing and order of immigration by founding populations), indicating that immigration and diversification may affect community assembly interactively. However, it remains unclear under what conditions immigration history affects diversification. Here we propose the hypothesis that whether or not immigration history influences the extent of diversification depends on the founding populations' prior evolutionary history, using evidence from a bacterial experiment. To create genotypes with different evolutionary histories, replicate populations of Pseudomonas fluorescens were allowed to adapt to a novel environment for a short or long period of time (approximately 10 or 100 bacterial generations) with or without exploiters (viral parasites). Each evolved genotype was then introduced to a new habitat either before or after a standard competitor genotype. Most genotypes diversified to a greater extent when introduced before, rather than after, the competitor. However, introduction order did not affect the extent of diversification when the evolved genotype had previously adapted to the environment for a long period of time without exploiters. Diversification of these populations was low regardless of introduction order. These results suggest that the importance of immigration history in diversification can be predicted by the immigrants' evolutionary past. The hypothesis proposed here may be generally applicable in both micro- and macro-organisms.},

  abstract = {Eusociality is taxonomically rare, yet associated with great ecological success. Surprisingly, studies of environmental conditions favouring eusociality are often contradictory. Harsh conditions associated with increasing altitude and latitude seem to favour increased sociality in bumblebees and ants, but the reverse pattern is found in halictid bees and polistine wasps. Here, we compare the life histories and distributions of populations of 176 species of Hymenoptera from the Swiss Alps. We show that differences in altitudinal distributions and development times among social forms can explain these contrasting patterns: highly social taxa develop more quickly than intermediate social taxa, and are thus able to complete the reproductive cycle in shorter seasons at higher elevations. This dual impact of altitude and development time on sociality illustrates that ecological constraints can elicit dynamic shifts in behaviour, and helps explain the complex distribution of sociality across ecological gradients.},

  abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile genetic elements that parasitize genomes by semi-autonomously increasing their own copy number within the host genome. While TEs are important for genome evolution, appropriate methods for performing unbiased genome-wide surveys of TE variation in natural populations have been lacking. Here, we describe a novel and cost-effective approach for estimating population frequencies of TE insertions using paired-end Illumina reads from a pooled population sample. Importantly, the method treats insertions present in and absent from the reference genome identically, allowing unbiased TE population frequency estimates. We apply this method to data from a natural Drosophila melanogaster population from Portugal. Consistent with previous reports, we show that low recombining genomic regions harbor more TE insertions and maintain insertions at higher frequencies than do high recombining regions. We conservatively estimate that there are almost twice as many "novel" TE insertion sites as sites known from the reference sequence in our population sample (6,824 novel versus 3,639 reference sites, with on average a 31-fold coverage per insertion site). Different families of transposable elements show large differences in their insertion densities and population frequencies. Our analyses suggest that the history of TE activity significantly contributes to this pattern, with recently active families segregating at lower frequencies than those active in the more distant past. Finally, using our high-resolution TE abundance measurements, we identified 13 candidate positively selected TE insertions based on their high population frequencies and on low Tajima's D values in their neighborhoods.},

Because the accuracy of Pool-Seq could be affected by many potential sources of error, several studies have determined, for example, the influence of sequencing technology, the library preparation protocol, and mapping parameters. Nevertheless, the impact of the mapping tools has not yet been evaluated. Using simulated and real Pool-Seq data, we demonstrate a substantial impact of the mapping tools, leading to characteristic false positives in genome-wide scans. The problem of false positives was particularly pronounced when data with different read lengths and insert sizes were compared. Out of 14 evaluated algorithms novoalign, bwa mem and clc4 are most suitable for mapping Pool-Seq data. Nevertheless, no single algorithm is sufficient for avoiding all false positives. We show that the intersection of the results of two mapping algorithms provides a simple, yet effective, strategy to eliminate false positives. We propose that the implementation of a consistent Pool-Seq bioinformatics pipeline, building on the recommendations of this study, can substantially increase the reliability of Pool-Seq results, in particular when libraries generated with different protocols are being compared.},

Follicle growth and vitellogenesis occurred from April to mid August during the dry winter. During this time reproductive females had elevated levels of plasma oestradiol-17p, testosterone, calcium and magnesium, but lowered levels ofiron. The measuring of plasma calcium was an 'early pr\textbullet gnancy' test, reliable up to four months before nesting. Elevated levels of plasma testosterone in reproductive females corresponded to the time of courtship and mating. Ovulation occurred during the latter half of August. Males had viable sperm from mid May to mid September, during the winter. Courtship and mating occurred from late June to mid August, when crocodiles were confined to pools. Females nested on the higher sand ridges in the dry river bed from early September to early October, and eggs hatched during December.},

Population dynamics, i.e. the demographic changes in populations, arise from life history decisions of individuals and thus are a product of selection, and selection, on the contrary, can be modified by such dynamical properties of the population as density and stability. It follows that generating predictions and testing them correctly requires considering this ecogenetic feedback loop whenever traits have demographic consequences, mediated via density dependence (or frequency dependence). This is not an easy challenge, and arguably theory has advanced at a greater pace than empirical research. However, theory would benefit from more interaction between related fields, as is evident in the many near-synonymous names that the ecogenetic loop has attracted. We also list encouraging examples where empiricists have shown feasible ways of addressing the question, ranging from advanced data analysis to experiments and comparative analyses of phylogenetic data.},

The universals of genome evolution can be accounted for by simple mathematical models similar to those used in statistical physics, such as the birth-death-innovation model. These models do not explicitly incorporate selection; therefore, the observed universal regularities do not appear to be shaped by selection but rather are emergent properties of gene ensembles.

However, given the relatively high error rates of such technologies, efficient and accurate assembly of large repeats and closely related haplotypes remains challenging. We address these issues with Canu, a successor of Celera Assembler that is specifically designed for noisy single-molecule sequences. Canu introduces support for nanopore sequencing, halves depth-of-coverage requirements, and improves assembly continuity while simultaneously reducing runtime by an order of magnitude on large genomes versus Celera Assembler 8.2. These advances result from new overlapping and assembly algorithms, including an adaptive overlapping strategy based ontf-idfweighted MinHash and a sparse assembly graph construction that avoids collapsing diverged repeats and haplotypes. We demonstrate that Canu can reliably assemble complete microbial genomes and near-complete eukaryotic chromosomes using either Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) or Oxford Nanopore technologies and achieves a contig NG50 of {$>$}21 Mbp on both human andDrosophila melanogasterPacBio data sets. For assembly structures that cannot be linearly represented, Canu provides graph-based assembly outputs in graphical fragment assembly (GFA) format for analysis or integration with complementary phasing and scaffolding techniques. The combination of such highly resolved assembly graphs with long-range scaffolding information promises the complete and automated assembly of complex genomes.},

  abstract = {1. Understanding how plant diversity influences higher trophic levels is important for predicting the consequences of global biodiversity loss. While early studies have focused on the effects of plant species richness, more recently a growing number of experiments have explored the effects of plant intraspecific diversity by manipulating the genotypic richness of plant communities. 2. By combining 162 estimates of effect size from 60 experimental studies, we examined the effects of plant genotypic richness on arthropods, one of the most diverse and abundant taxa which play a crucial role in many ecosystem processes and services. We have also compared the effects of plant genetic and species diversity on arthropods when both were manipulated within the same study. 3. Species richness and abundance of most trophic groups of arthropods were higher in genetically diverse plant stands. Interestingly, the effects of plant genetic diversity on natural enemies of herbivores were stronger than the effects of plant genetic diversity on herbivores, suggesting that plant genetic diversity effects on predators might be driven by mechanisms independent of herbivores. 4. Herbivore and predator abundance increased with plant genetic diversity in studies using wild plants whereas predator abundance was unaffected and herbivore abundance was reduced by crop genetic diversity. Damage by generalist herbivores was reduced by plant genetic diversity whereas damage by specialist herbivores was not affected. 5. When the effects of plant genetic and species diversity on arthropods were compared within the same study, the magnitude of plant genetic diversity effects was comparable to that of plant species diversity. 6. Our results suggest that plant genetic diversity has significant effects on the diversity of arthropods across several trophic levels, thus highlighting the importance of maintaining high levels of both plant species and genetic diversity for arthropod conservation. However, the potential of using crop genetic mixtures in agriculture for pest control appears to be limited as even though herbivore abundance was reduced in genetically diverse plots, herbivore damage and predator abundance were not affected by crop genotypic richness.},

  abstract = {The predominant emphasis on harmful effects of environmental stresses on growth of woody plants has obscured some very beneficial effects of such stresses. Slowly increasing stresses may induce physiological adjustment that protects plants from the growth inhibition and/or injury that follow when environmental stresses are abruptly imposed. In addition, short exposures of woody plants to extreme environmental conditions at critical times in their development often improve growth. Furthermore, maintaining harvested seedlings and plant products at very low temperatures extends their longevity. Drought tolerance: Seedlings previously exposed to water stress often undergo less inhibition of growth and other processes following transplanting than do seedlings not previously exposed to such stress. Controlled wetting and drying cycles often promote early budset, dormancy, and drought tolerance. In many species increased drought tolerance following such cycles is associated with osmotic adjustment that involves accumulation of osmotically active substances, Maintenance of leaf turgor often is linked to osmotic adjustment. A reduction in osmotic volume at full turgor also results in reduced osmotic potential, even in the absence of solute accumulation. Changes in tissue elasticity may be important for turgor maintenance and drought tolerance of plants that do not adjust osmotically. Water deficits and nutrient deficiencies promote greater relative allocation of photosynthate to root growth, ultimately resulting in plants that have higher root:shoot ratios and greater capacity to absorb water and minerals relative to the shoots that must be supported. At the molecular level, plants respond to water stress by synthesis of certain new proteins and increased levels of synthesis of some proteins produced under well-watered conditions. Evidence has been obtained for enhanced synthesis under water stress of water-channel proteins and other proteins that may protect membranes and other important macromolecules from damage and denaturation as cells dehydrate. Flood tolerance: Both artificial and natural flooding sometimes benefit woody plants. Flooding of orchard soils has been an essential management practice for centuries to increase fruit yields and improve fruit quality. Also, annual advances and recessions of floods are crucial for maintaining valuable riparian forests. Intermittent flooding protects bottomland forests by increasing groundwater supplies, transporting sediments necessary for creating favorable seedbeds, and regulating decomposition of organic matter. Major adaptations for flood tolerance of some woody plants include high capacity for producing adventitious roots that compensate physiologically for decay of original roots under soil anaerobiosis, facilitation of oxygen up-take through stomata and newly formed lenticels, and metabolic adjustments. Halophytes can adapt to saline water by salt tolerance, salt avoidance, or both. Cold hardiness: Environmental stresses that inhibit plant growth, including low temperature, drought, short days, and combinations of these, induce cold hardening and hardiness in many species. Cold hardiness develops in two stages: at temperatures between 10degrees and 20degreesC in the autumn, when carbohydrates and lipids accumulate; and at subsequent freezing temperatures. The sum of many biochemical processes determines the degree of cold tolerance. Some of these processes are hormone dependent and induced by short days; others that are linked to activity of enzyme systems are temperature dependent. Short days are important for development of cold hardiness in species that set buds or respond strongly to photoperiod. Nursery managers often expose tree seedlings to moderate water stress at or near the end of die growing season. This accelerates budset, induces early dormancy, and increases cold hardiness. Pollution tolerance: Absorption of gaseous air pollutants varies with resistance to flow along the pollutant's diffusion path. Hence, the amount of pollutant absorbed by leaves depends on stomatal aperture, stomatal size, and stomatal frequency. Pollution tolerance is increased when drought, dry air, or flooding of soil close stomatal pores. Heat tolerance: Exposure to sublethal high temperature can increase the thermotolerance of plants. Potential mechanisms of response include synthesis of heat-shock proteins and isoprene and antioxidant production to protect the photosynthetic apparatus and cellular metabolism. Breaking of dormancy: Seed dormancy can be broken by cold or heat. Embryo dormancy is broken by prolonged exposure of most seeds to temperatures of 1degrees to 15degreesC. The efficiency of treatment depends on interactions between temperature and seed moisture content. Germination can be postponed by partially dehydrating seeds or altering the temperature during seed stratification. Seed-coat dormancy can be broken by fires that rupture seed coats or melt seed-coat waxes, hence promoting water uptake. Seeds with both embryo dormancy and seed-coat dormancy may require exposure to both high and low temperatures to break dormancy. Exposure to smoke itself can also serve as a germination cue in breaking seed dormancy in some species. Bud dormancy of temperate-zone trees is broken by winter cold. The specific chilling requirement varies widely with species and genotype, type of bud (e.g., vegetative or floral bud), depth of dormancy, temperature, duration of chilling, stage of plant development, and daylength, Interruption of a cold regime by high temperature may negate the effect of sustained chilling or breaking of bud dormancy. Near-lethal heat stress may release buds from both endodormancy and ecodormancy. Pollen shedding: Dehiscence of anthers and release of pollen result from dehydration of walls of anther sacs. Both seasonal and diurnal pollen shedding are commonly associated with shrinkage and rupture of anther walls by low relative humidity. Pollen shedding typically is maximal near midday (low relative humidity) and low at night (high relative humidity). Pollen shedding is low or negligible during rainy periods. Seed dispersal: Gymnosperm cones typically dehydrate before opening. The cones open and shed seeds because of differential shrinkage between the adaxial and abaxial tissues of cone scales. Once opened, cones may close and reopen with changes in relative humidity. Both dehydration and heat are necessary for seed dispersal from serotinous (late-to-open) cones. Seeds are stored in serotinous cones because resinous bonds of scales prevent cone opening. After fire melts the resinous material, the cone scales can open on drying. Fires also stimulate germination of seeds of some species. Some heath plants require fire to open their serotinous follicles and shed seeds. Fire destroys the resin at the valves of follicles, and the valves then reflex to release the seeds. Following fire the follicles of some species require alternate wetting and drying for efficient seed dispersal. Stimulation of reproductive growth., Vegetative and reproductive growth of woody plants are negatively correlated. A heavy crop of fruits, cones, and seeds is associated with reduced vegetative growth in the same or following year (or even years). Subjecting trees to drought during early stages of fruit development to inhibit vegetative growth, followed by normal irrigation, sometimes favors reproductive growth. Short periods of drought at critical times not only induce formation of flower buds but also break dormancy of flower buds in some species. Water deficits may induce flowering directly or by inhibiting shoot flushing, thereby limiting the capacity of young leaves to inhibit floral induction. Postharvest water stress often results in abundant return bloom over that in well-irrigated plants. Fruit yields of some species are not reduced or are increased by withholding irrigation during the period of shoot elongation. In several species, osmotic adjustment occurs during deficit irrigation. In other species, increased fruit growth by imposed drought is not associated largely with osmotic adjustment and maintenance of leaf turgor. Seedling storage: Tree seedlings typically are stored at temperatures just above or below freezing. Growth and survival of cold-stored seedlings depend on such factors as: date of lifting from the nursery; species and genotype; storage temperature, humidity, and illumination; duration of storage; and handling of planting stock after storage. Seedlings to be stored over winter should be lifted from the nursery as late as possible. Dehydration of seedlings before, during, and after storage adversely affects growth of outplanted seedlings. Long-term storage of seedlings may result in depletion of stored carbohydrates by respiration and decrease of root growth potential. Although many seedlings are stored in darkness, a daily photoperiod during cold storage may stimulate subsequent growth and increase survival of outplanted seedlings. For some species, rapid thawing may decrease respiratory consumption of carbohydrates (over slowly thawed seedlings) and decrease development of molds. Pollen storage: Preservation of pollen is necessary for insurance against poor flowering years, for gene conservation, and for physiological and biochemical studies. Storage temperature and pollen moisture content largely determine longevity of stored pollen. Pollen can be stored successfully for many years in deep freezers at temperatures near -15degreesC or in liquid nitrogen (-196degreesC). Cryopreservation of pollen with a high moisture content is difficult because ice crystals may destroy the cells. Pollens of many species do not survive at temperatures below -40degreesC if their moisture contents exceed 20-30\%. Pollen generally is air dried, vacuum dried, or freeze dried before it is stored. To preserve the germination capacity of stored pollen, rehydration at high humidity often},

  abstract = {Significance             Biologists have long understood that differences between species in traits such as bill shape or rooting depth can maintain diversity in communities by promoting specialization and reducing competition. Here we test the assumption that phenotypic differences drive the stabilizing niche differences that promote coexistence. Using advances in ecological theory and detailed experiments we quantify average fitness and stabilizing niche differences between 102 plant species pairs and relate these differences to 11 functional traits. Individual traits were correlated with fitness differences that drive competitive exclusion but not stabilizing niche differences that promote coexistence. Stabilizing niche differences could only be described by combinations of traits, representing differentiation in multiple dimensions. This challenges the simplistic use of trait patterns to infer community assembly.           ,              Understanding the processes maintaining species diversity is a central problem in ecology, with implications for the conservation and management of ecosystems. Although biologists often assume that trait differences between competitors promote diversity, empirical evidence connecting functional traits to the niche differences that stabilize species coexistence is rare. Obtaining such evidence is critical because traits also underlie the average fitness differences driving competitive exclusion, and this complicates efforts to infer community dynamics from phenotypic patterns. We coupled field-parameterized mathematical models of competition between 102 pairs of annual plants with detailed sampling of leaf, seed, root, and whole-plant functional traits to relate phenotypic differences to stabilizing niche and average fitness differences. Single functional traits were often well correlated with average fitness differences between species, indicating that competitive dominance was associated with late phenology, deep rooting, and several other traits. In contrast, single functional traits were poorly correlated with the stabilizing niche differences that promote coexistence. Niche differences could only be described by combinations of traits, corresponding to differentiation between species in multiple ecological dimensions. In addition, several traits were associated with both fitness differences and stabilizing niche differences. These complex relationships between phenotypic differences and the dynamics of competing species argue against the simple use of single functional traits to infer community assembly processes but lay the groundwork for a theoretically justified trait-based community ecology.},

  abstract = {Populations do not increase without limit, and one of the central problems of population biology is to explain why. The self-regulation hypothesis states that indefinite increase in population density is prevented by a change in the quality of the population. Changes in quality may be physiological or behavioural, genotypic or phenotypic, and three different mechanisms of self-regulation have been proposed: (1) the Stress Hypothesis suggests that mutual interactions lead to physiological changes, phenotypic in origin, that reduce births and increase deaths. (2) The Behaviour Hypothesis suggests that mutual interactions involving spacing behaviour prevent unlimited increase and that spacing behaviour is not an inherited trait. (3) The Chitty Hypothesis, or polymorphic behaviour hypothesis, postulates that spacing behaviour limits population density and that individual differences in spacing behaviour have a genetic basis and respond to rapid natural selection.The testability of the Chitty Hypothesis is examined with regard to 13 predictions that are explicit in Chitty's writings or derived by subsequent workers. Many of the predictions are not unique to the Chitty Hypothesis and only a few difficult manipulations adequately test Chitty's proposed mechanism to the exclusion of all others.Four population studies are reviewed with reference to the Chitty Hypothesis. While the detailed mechanism proposed by Chitty is not yet adequately tested in any population, his general belief that both behaviour and genetics are relevant to understanding population problems is now assumed by the new generation of population biologists.},

Models of coexistence often assume that species have fixed trait values and consider questions such as how tradeoffs and environmental variation influence coexistence and diversity. However, species traits can be dynamic, varying between populations and individuals and changing over time as species adapt and evolve, at rates that are relevant to ecological processes. Consequently, adding evolution to ecological coexistence models may modify their predictions and stability in complex or unexpected ways. We extend a well-studied coexistence mechanism depending on resource fluctuations by allowing evolution along a tradeoff between maximum growth rate and competitive ability. Interactions between favorable season length and the period of fluctuations constrain coexistence, with two species coexistence favored by intermediate season length and arising through evolutionary branching or non-local invasion. However, these results depend on the relative rates of ecological and evolutionary processes: rapid evolution leads to a complete breakdown of otherwise stable coexistence. Other coexistence mechanisms should be evaluated from an evolutionary perspective to examine how evolutionary forces may alter predicted ecological dynamics.},

Members of these communities possess distinct environmental preferences, revealing widespread patterns of limiting similarity.

Our TimeTree resource is a public knowledge-base with the primary focus to make available all species divergence times derived using molecular sequence data to scientists, educators, and the general public in a consistent and accessible format. Here, we report a major expansion of the TimeTree resource, which more than triples the number of species ({$>$}97,000) and more than triples the number of studies assembled ({$>$}3,000). Furthermore, scientists can access not only the divergence time between two species or higher taxa, but also a timetree of a group of species and a timeline that traces a species' evolution through time. The new timetree and timeline visualizations are integrated with display of events on earth and environmental history over geological time, which will lead to broader and better understanding of the interplay of the change in the biosphere with the diversity of species on Earth. The next generation TimeTree resource is publicly available online at http://www.timetree.org.},

Therefore, a better understanding of the evolution of plant defenses against their herbivores may be central for our understanding of tropical biodiversity. Here, we address the evolution of antiherbivore defenses and their possible contribution to coexistence in the Neotropical tree genus Inga (Fabaceae). Inga has {$>$}300 species, has radiated recently, and is frequently one of the most diverse and abundant genera at a given site. For 37 species from Panama and Peru we characterized developmental, ant, and chemical defenses against herbivores. We found extensive variation in defenses, but little evidence of phylogenetic signal. Furthermore, in a multivariate analysis, developmental, ant, and chemical defenses varied independently (were orthogonal) and appear to have evolved independently of each other. Our results are consistent with strong selection for divergent defensive traits, presumably mediated by herbivores. In an analysis of community assembly, we found that Inga species co-occurring as neighbors are more different in antiherbivore defenses than random, suggesting that possessing a rare defense phenotype increases fitness. These results imply that interactions with herbivores may be an important axis of niche differentiation that permits the coexistence of many species of Inga within a single site. Interactions between plants and their herbivores likely play a key role in the generation and maintenance of the conspicuously high plant diversity in the tropics.},

  abstract = {The White Ibis population nesting in the fluctuating water ecosystem of southern Florida numbered up to 62,000 birds and used several nesting habitats including islands in large lakes, the vast freshwater marshes of the Everglades, and coastal estuaries. Periodic reproduction at large inland colonies, accounting for 93-98\% of the nesting birds, sustains the population at its current level, but smaller, more consistantly successful coastal colonies provide recruitment during years of inland nesting failure. Clutch size, brood reduction pattern, and energy requirements showed intraregional variation. Clutch size differences may be related to habitat, with lowered clutch sizes along the coast. Despite clutch size differences, the number of young fledged was similar in different colonies. Intraregional variation in timing of brood reduction resulted in differences in the energy required for nesting. The daily energy expenditure of White Ibis was estimated from the time-activity budget and multiples of measured metabolic rates. Although existence metabolism was similar to that predicted by Kendeigh's (1970) regression, daily energy expenditure was considerably below that predicted by extrapolating King's (1974) regression, suggesting a slower increase of DEE at higher body weights. The White Ibis consumed about 21\% of its body weight daily, similar to that found in other studies of ciconiiformes. The energy required to raise a brood of young was \$9.2-9.9\textbackslash times 10\^\{3\}\textbackslash{} \{\textbackslash rm kcal\}\$. The nesting population expended 930 and \$640\textbackslash times 10\^\{6\}\textbackslash{} \{\textbackslash rm kcal\}\$ during 1972 and 1973 respectively. Over 70\% of this energy was derived from the Everglades and over 90\% from inland habitats. Contrasted with the Wood Stork, the smaller size and shorter nesting cycle enables nesting White Ibis to support 11 times the population on 1.1 times the energy. The ability of smaller birds to maintain higher populations on a given resource base may supply a competitive advantage during times of intense resource-based selection. Together the south Florida populations of White Ibis and Wood Storks require 1.9 billion kilocalories per nesting season and are important determinants of energy flow in the wetland ecosystem.},

The niche describes how an organism with a particular phenotype performs in its demography (birth and death rates) as a function of environmental conditions. Given genetic variation in these traits, niches can evolve, sometimes quite rapidly, but niches also can show surprising conservatism. To understand niche evo- lution, one must draw on and integrate many areas of knowledge, ranging from detailed mechanistic under- standing of individual performance to the mapping of genes to phenotypes, from life histories, mating systems, and population dynamics to population genetics, com- munity ecology, and the broad spatial and historical perspectives of landscape ecology, biogeography, and paleobiology. Understanding niche evolution and con- servatism is important to many basic questions in evo- lution, ecology, and biogeography, and it is also highly germane to many crucial applied issues.}

The genome of Ch. tentans is approximately 200\&nbsp;Mb in size, and has a low GC content (31\%) and a low repeat fraction (15\%) compared to other Dipteran species. Phylogenetic inference revealed that Ch. tentans is a sister clade to mosquitoes, with a split 150\textendash 250 million years ago. To characterize the Ch. tentans gene expression machineries, we identified potential orthologus sequences to more than 600 Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster) proteins involved in the expression of protein-coding genes. We report novel data on the organization of the BR gene loci, including a novel putative BR gene, and we present a model for the organization of chromatin bundles in the BR2 puff based on genic and intergenic in situ hybridizations. We show that the molecular machineries operating in gene expression are largely conserved between Ch. tentans and D. melanogaster, and we provide enhanced insight into the organization and expression of the BR genes. Our data strengthen the generality of the BR genes as a unique model system and provide essential background for in-depth studies of the biogenesis of messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes.},

  abstract = {In order to be transmitted, a pathogen must first successfully colonize and multiply within a host. Ecological principles can be applied to study host-pathogen interactions to predict transmission dynamics. Little is known about the population biology of Salmonella during persistent infection. To define Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium population structure in this context, 129SvJ mice were oral gavaged with a mixture of eight wild-type isogenic tagged Salmonella (WITS) strains. Distinct subpopulations arose within intestinal and systemic tissues after 35 days, and clonal expansion of the cecal and colonic subpopulation was responsible for increases in Salmonella fecal shedding. A co-infection system utilizing differentially marked isogenic strains was developed in which each mouse received one strain orally and the other systemically by intraperitoneal (IP) injection. Co-infections demonstrated that the intestinal subpopulation exerted intraspecies priority effects by excluding systemic S. Typhimurium from colonizing an extracellular niche within the cecum and colon. Importantly, the systemic strain was excluded from these distal gut sites and was not transmitted to na\textasciidieresis\i ve hosts. In addition, S. Typhimurium required hydrogenase, an enzyme that mediates acquisition of hydrogen from the gut microbiota, during the first week of infection to exert priority effects in the gut. Thus, early inhibitory priority effects are facilitated by the acquisition of nutrients, which allow S. Typhimurium to successfully compete for a nutritional niche in the distal gut. We also show that intraspecies colonization resistance is maintained by Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands SPI1 and SPI2 during persistent distal gut infection. Thus, important virulence effectors not only modulate interactions with host cells, but are crucial for Salmonella colonization of an extracellular intestinal niche and thereby also shape intraspecies dynamics. We conclude that priority effects and intraspecies competition for colonization niches in the distal gut control Salmonella population assembly and transmission.},

  abstract = {The nonrandom distribution of meiotic recombination shapes heredity and genetic diversification. Theoretically, hotspots--favored sites of recombination initiation--either evolve rapidly toward extinction or are conserved, especially if they are chromosomal features under selective constraint, such as promoters. We tested these theories by comparing genome-wide recombination initiation maps from widely divergent Saccharomyces species. We find that hotspots frequently overlap with promoters in the species tested, and consequently, hotspot positions are well conserved. Remarkably, the relative strength of individual hotspots is also highly conserved, as are larger-scale features of the distribution of recombination initiation. This stability, not predicted by prior models, suggests that the particular shape of the yeast recombination landscape is adaptive and helps in understanding evolutionary dynamics of recombination in other species.},

Since the pineal is believed to play a role in the regulation of photoperiodic control of circadian rhythms in activity and corticosterone secretion in vertebrates, plasma corticosterone was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) in samples collected over a 24-hr period from cap- tive-reared, juvenile crocodilians (Alligator mississippiensis) held under a constant temper- ature but exposed to natural photoperiod. A clear biphasic rhythm in plasma corticosterone levels was observed, with a peak at 0800 hr and a second peak at 2000 hr, which corresponds to the biphasic activity cycle of this reptile. A single injection of 8 IU of mammalian ACTH into juvenile alligators resulted in a significant increase in corticosterone levels by 1 hr; hormone levels remained elevated for 24 hr, returning to baseline by 48 hr. Whereas handling and bleeding the alligators caused a significant increase in plasma corticosterone at 1, 4, and 24 hr, hormone levels in the ACTH-injected animals were significantly higher than the saline-injected controls at these times. Corticosterone levels in alligators range between 0.1 and 6 rig/ml as measured by RIA. These values are an order of magnitude lower than values previously reported for crocodilians.},

Plasma testosterone declined to 50\% of the initial value by 4 hr and dropped to less than 10\% of initial by 24 hr. Plasma corticosterone increased during the first 12 hr, declined at 24 hr, and rose again at 40 hr. Blood samples from male alligators collected in North and South Carolina, south Florida, and in south Louisiana in two consecutive breeding seasons were also assayed for testosterone and corticosterone. In these populations there were significant differences in mean plasma testosterone and corticosterone levels. Elevated corticosterone levels were consistently seen in alligators caught in traps and from which a blood sample was taken several hours later. Plasma testosterone, although consistently lower in trapped alligators, did not show a negative correlation with plasma corticosterone. Farm-reared alligators bled once, released, and bled again at 24 hr also showed a highly significant suppression of testosterone secretion. These results demonstrate that stress has a rapid and dramatic effect on testicular steroid secretion in both farm-reared and wild alligators.},

The white blood cells showed changes indicating immune system suppression. By the end of the treatment the hetorophil/lymphocyte ratio increased to 4.7.

Our goals included examining (i) within population variation in multiple paternity among years, (ii) variation in multiple paternity in individual females and (iii) the potential for mate fidelity. To accomplish this, in the current study, eggs were sampled from 92 nests over 6 years and analysed along with 22 nests from a previous 2-year study. Genotypes at five microsatellite loci were generated for 1802 alligator hatchlings. Multiple paternity was found in 51\% of clutches and paternal contributions to these clutches were highly skewed. Rates of multiple paternity varied widely among years and were consistently higher in the current study than previously reported for the same population. Larger females have larger clutches, but are not more likely to have multiply sired nests. However, small females are unlikely to have clutches with more than two sires. For 10 females, nests from multiple years were examined. Seven (70\%) of these females exhibited long-term mate fidelity, with one female mating with the same male in 1997, 2002 and 2005. Five females exhibiting partial mate fidelity (71\%) had at least one multiple paternity nest and thus mated with the same male, but not exclusively. These patterns of mate fidelity suggest a potential role for mate choice in alligators.},

We present results from a study testing the efficacy of using ultrasonography to monitor reproduction in the American alligator, Alligator mississippiensis. Ultrasound results were then compared with plasma hormone levels. A total of 124 females were examined during March, April, May, and early June (2001-2003). Ultrasound results were validated on a series of reproductive females (n=14) necropsied for other studies. Previtellogenic follicles, vitellogenic follicles, recently shelled eggs, fully developed well-calcified eggs, and atretic follicles were readily discernible with ultrasound in mature females. Reproductive structures were observed in 57 females of which 43 were actively reproductive, while 14 were non-reproductive, but contained large atretic follicles from prior years. Oviducts were discernible in females with eggs. Ovarian state was also correlated with hormone levels. These results are in agreement with previous studies that showed that 50\% or less of the adult female alligator population is reproductively active in a given year. Ultrasonography can be used to make an accurate assessment of reproductive condition in wild alligator populations.},

Through our experience in performing ChIP-seq experiments, the ENCODE and modENCODE consortia have developed a set of working standards and guidelines for ChIP experiments that are updated routinely. The current guidelines address antibody validation, experimental replication, sequencing depth, data and metadata reporting, and data quality assessment. We discuss how ChIP quality, assessed in these ways, affects different uses of ChIP-seq data.

  abstract = {The adaptive value of phenotypic plasticity depends upon the degree of match achieved between phenotype and environment. This match is governed in part by how well organisms discern environmental states (e.g. presence or absence of particular predators). To examine the specificity with which organisms use cues to induce defensive phenotypes, we raised freshwater snails, Physella virgata, with either molluscivorous or non-molluscivorous sunfish species (Lepomis cyanellus, L. gibbosus, L. macrochirus, L. megalotis, L. microlophus, Micropterus salmoides). Regardless of the predator class with which they were raised, snails exhibited two induced responses: (1) reduced growth and (2) development of rotund shells. Reduced growth typically results from predator avoidance behaviours and so is associated with a net survival benefit in environments containing molluscivores. Rotund shells increase crush resistance and so increase both handling time and rejection rates by molluscivorous sunfish. Despite the adaptive nature of these responses to molluscivorous species, responding unnecessarily to non-molluscivores is maladaptive. Growth reduction limits fecundity and prevents snails from attaining size refugia for most predators. Rotund shells increase vulnerability to shell-entry predators, which are typically more common than shell-crushing predators. Thus the induced responses entail costs but award no advantages in the presence of non-molluscivorous sunfish. Lack of specificity in use of cues (e.g. all sunfish treated alike) may be a major constraint on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. Furthermore, these induced responses may produce trait-mediated indirect effects that cascade throughout the food web.},

Evidence of interactions between natural selection and genetic linkage is abundant not only in centromere- and telomere-proximal regions, but also throughout the euchromatic arms. Linkage disequilibrium, which decays within 1 kbp, exhibits a strong bias toward coupling of the more frequent alleles and provides a high-resolution map of recombination rate. The juxtaposition of population genetics statistics in small genomic windows with gene structures and chromatin states yields a rich, high-resolution annotation, including the following: (1) 5'- and 3'-UTRs are enriched for regions of reduced polymorphism relative to lineage-specific divergence; (2) exons overlap with windows of excess relative polymorphism; (3) epigenetic marks associated with active transcription initiation sites overlap with regions of reduced relative polymorphism and relatively reduced estimates of the rate of recombination; (4) the rate of adaptive nonsynonymous fixation increases with the rate of crossing over per base pair; and (5) both duplications and deletions are enriched near origins of replication and their density correlates negatively with the rate of crossing over. Available demographic models of X and autosome descent cannot account for the increased divergence on the X and loss of diversity associated with the out-of-Africa migration. Comparison of the variation among these genomes to variation among genomes from D. simulans suggests that many targets of directional selection are shared between these species.},

Alliaria petiolata               is a Eurasian species that aggressively invades North American forest understories, in part due to the production of toxic phytochemicals. Here we document a marked decline in its phytotoxin production and a consequent decline in their impact on three native species, across a 50+ year chronosequence of               Alliaria petiolata               invasion. Genetic evidence suggests that these patterns result from natural selection for decreased phytotoxin production rather than founder effects during introduction and spread. These patterns are consistent with the finding of slowing               A. petiolata               population growth and rebounding native species abundance across a separate chronosequence in Illinois, U.S. These results suggest that this invader is developing evolutionary limits in its introduced range and highlight the importance of understanding the long-term processes that shape species invasions and their impacts.},

Four non-exclusive explanations may explain this range expansion: introductions, mesopredator release, availability and suitability of winter denning sites, and food availability. No introductions of raccoons were documented for the prairies, suggesting that range expansion was not directly caused by humans. The suggestion that raccoons moved north because of "mesopredator release" appears implausible because, even where larger predators such as bobcats (Lynx rufus) and coyotes (Canis latrans) exist, raccoons experience low predation rates and also because raccoons have expanded their range into treeless areas where coyotes are abundant. The third hypothesis, suggesting that availability of winter denning sites limits raccoon distribution, also receives little support, mostly because of the raccoon's flexibility in using a variety of natural and anthropogenic structures for denning. The last hypothesis, the idea that raccoon range expansion has followed an increase in availability of food, appears most plausible. The effects of global warming, which affects not only the availability and diversity of foods but also the duration of the growing season (and thus temporal availability of food), probably helped raccoons colonize new areas.},

Here, we focus on the invasive wetland grass Phalaris arundinacea L. and document the evolutionary consequences that resulted from multiple and uncontrolled introductions into North America of genetic material native to different European regions. Continental-scale genetic variation occurring in reed canarygrass' European range has been reshuffled and recombined within North American introduced populations, giving rise to a number of novel genotypes. This process alleviated genetic bottlenecks throughout reed canarygrass' introduced range, including in peripheral populations, where depletion of genetic diversity is expected and is observed in the native range. Moreover, reed canarygrass had higher genetic diversity and heritable phenotypic variation in its invasive range relative to its native range. The resulting high evolutionary potential of invasive populations allowed for rapid selection of genotypes with higher vegetative colonization ability and phenotypic plasticity. Our results show that repeated introductions of a single species may inadvertently create harmful invaders with high adaptive potential. Such invasive species may be able to evolve in response to changing climate, allowing them to have increasing impact on native communities and ecosystems in the future. More generally, multiple immigration events may thus trigger future adaptation and geographic spread of a species population by preventing genetic bottlenecks and generating genetic novelties through recombination.},

A model for evolution of body size under asymmetric competition within and between species is described. The model links processes operating at the scale of the individual to that of macroscopic evolution through a stochastic mutation-selection process. Phase portraits of evolution in a phenotype space characteristically show character convergence and parallel character shifts, with character divergence being relatively uncommon. The asymptotic states of evolution depend very much on the properties of asymmetric competition. Given relatively weak asymmetries between species, a single equilibrium point exists; this is a local attractor, and its position is determined by the intra- and interspecific asymmetries. When the asymmetries are made stronger, several fixed points may come about, creating further equilibrium points which are local attractors. It is also possible for periodic attractors to occur; such attractors comprise Red Queen dynamics with phenotype values that continue to change without ever settling down to constant values. From certain initial conditions, evolution leading to extinction of one of the species is also a likely outcome.},

  abstract = {Given that the genome of males and females are almost identical with the exception of genes on the Y (or W) chromosome or sex-determining alleles (in organisms without sex chromosomes), it is likely that many downstream processes resulting in sexual dimorphism are produced by changes in regulation. In early stages of sex chromosome evolution, as the Y-chromosome degenerates, gene expression should be significantly impacted for genes residing on the sex chromosome pair as regulatory mutations accumulate. However, this has rarely been examined because most model organisms have clearly diverged sex chromosomes. Fish provide a unique opportunity to examine the evolution of sex chromosomes because genetic sex determination has evolved quite recently in some groups of fish. We compared sex-specific transcription in threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) liver tissue using a long-oligo microarray. Of the 1,268 genes that were differentially expressed between sexes, a highly significant proportion (23\%) was concentrated on chromosome 19, corresponding to the recently described nascent sex chromosomes. The sex-biased genes are enriched for different functional categories in males and females, although there is no specific functional enrichment on the sex chromosomes. Female-biased genes are concentrated at one end of the sex chromosome, corresponding to a deletion in the Y, suggesting a lack of global dosage compensation. Prior research on threespine sticklebacks has demonstrated various degrees of dissimilarity in upstream regions of genes on the Y providing a potential mechanism for the observed patterns of female-biased expression. We hypothesize that degeneration of the Y chromosome results in regulatory mutations that create a sex-specific expression pattern and that this physical concentration of sex-biased expression on the nascent sex chromosome may be a key feature characterizing intermediate phases of sex chromosome evolution.},

  abstract = {The evolutionary genetics of invasive species has been relatively unexplored, but could offer insights into mechanisms of invasions. Recent studies suggest that the invasion success of many species alight depend more heavily on their ability to respond to natural selection than on broad physiological tolerance or plasticity. Thus, these studies stress the importance of genetic architecture, selection upon which could result in evolutionary adaptations and possibly speciation. For instance, epistatic interactions and the action of a few genes could facilitate invasion success. These findings emphasize the utility of genomic approaches for determining invasion mechanisms, through analysis of gene expression, gene interactions, and genomic rearrangements that are associated with invasion events.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             Rapid cold-hardening (RCH) is well known to increase the tolerance of chilling or cold shock in a diverse array of invertebrate systems at both organismal and cellular levels. Here, we report a novel role for RCH by showing that RCH also increases freezing tolerance in an Antarctic midge, Belgica antarctica (Diptera, Chironomidae). The RCH response of B. antarctica was investigated under two distinct physiological states: summer acclimatized and cold acclimated. Summer-acclimatized larvae were less cold tolerant, as indicated by low survival following exposure to-10\textdegree C for 24 h; by contrast, nearly all cold-acclimated larvae survived-10\textdegree C, and a significant number could survive -15\textdegree C. Cold-acclimated larvae had higher supercooling points than summer larvae. To evaluate the RCH response in summer-acclimatized midges, larvae and adults, maintained at 4\textdegree C, were transferred to -5\textdegree C for 1 h prior to exposures to -10, -15 or -20\textdegree C. RCH significantly increased survival of summer-acclimatized larvae frozen at -10\textdegree C for 1 h compared with larvae receiving no cold-hardening treatment, but adults, which live for only a week or so in the austral summer, lacked the capacity for RCH. In cold-acclimated larvae, RCH significantly increased freeze tolerance to both -15 and -20\textdegree C. Similarly,RCH significantly increased cellular survival of fat body, Malpighian tubules and gut tissue from cold-acclimated larvae frozen at -20\textdegree C for 24 h. These results indicate that RCH not only protects against non-freezing injury but also increases freeze tolerance.},

  abstract = {Competitive coexistence depends on dynamic interactions between competitor and resource populations, including mutualism between the resource and each competitor. We add mutualism to a well-known model of resource competition and show that it can powerfully stabilize competitive coexistence in the absence or presence of resource heterogeneity. We use a transition matrix approach to describe lottery competition, while allowing each of two competitors to affect the population dynamics of their shared resource. For example, two plant-defending ant species may compete for nesting space within ant-adapted (myrmecophytic) plants. We show that mutualism between consumers and a resource species can stabilize competitive coexistence of the consumers by allowing each competitor to influence resource dynamics in a way that benefits the other. The effect of this novel coexistence mechanism depends on a mutualism's biological details: for example, altering myrmecophyte fecundity affects competing ant species differently than does altering plant survival. Finally, we consider a heterogeneous resource (e.g., two types of nest site) and show how niche partitioning can stabilize coexistence in the absence of resource dynamics. When resource heterogeneity is dynamic (e.g., small and large plants of the same species), niche partitioning also provides new routes for additional stabilization via mutualism. \textcopyright{} 2010 by The University of Chicago.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity in natural systems can be maintained either because niche differentiation among competitors facilitates stable coexistence or because equal fitness among neutral species allows for their long-term cooccurrence despite a slow drift toward extinction. Whereas the relative importance of these two ecological mechanisms has been well-studied in the absence of evolution, the role of local adaptive evolution in maintaining biological diversity through these processes is less clear. Here we study the contribution of local adaptive evolution to coexistence in a landscape of interconnected patches subject to disturbance. Under these conditions, early colonists to empty patches may adapt to local conditions sufficiently fast to prevent successful colonization by other preadapted species. Over the long term, the iteration of these local-scale priority effects results in niche convergence of species at the regional scale even though species tend to monopolize local patches. Thus, the dynamics evolve from stable coexistence through niche differentiation to neutral cooccurrence at the landscape level while still maintaining strong local niche segregation. Our results show that neutrality can emerge at the regional scale from local, niche-based adaptive evolution, potentially resolving why ecologists often observe neutral distribution patterns at the landscape level despite strong niche divergence among local communities.},

In addition, we are concerned with the pattern of adaptation itself, particularly whether the rate of increase in mean fitness tends to decline with the number of generations of selection in a constant environment. The correspondence between the rate of increase in mean fitness and the within-population genetic variance of fitness, as expected from Fisher's fundamental theorem, is also addressed. Twelve Escherichia coli populations were founded from a single clonal ancestor and allowed to evolve for 2,000 generations. Mean fitness increased by about 37\%. However, the rate of increase in mean fitness was slower in later generations. There was no statistically significant within-population genetic variance of fitness, but there was significant between-population variance. Although the estimated genetic variation in fitness within populations was not statistically significant, it was consistent in magnitude with theoretical expectations. Similarly, the variance of mean fitness between populations was consistent with a model that incorporated stochastic variation in the timing and order of substitutions at a finite number of nonepistatic loci, coupled with substitutional delays and interference between substitutions arising from clonality. These results, taken as a whole, are consistent with theoretical expectations that do not invoke divergence due to multiple fitness peaks in a Wrightian evolutionary landscape.},

We measured the fitness of alfalfa- and clover-derived aphids on both types of plants and found no evidence for specialization when all aphid lineages were considered simultaneously. We then screened all aphids for the presence of four facultative bacterial symbionts: PAR, PASS, PABS and PAUS. Aphids with PAUS were host-plant specialized, having twice as many offspring as other aphids on clover, and dying on alfalfa. Other aphids showed no evidence of specialization. Additionally, aphids with PABS had 50\% more offspring than aphids with PASS when on alfalfa. Thus, specialist and generalist aphid lineages coexist, and specialization is symbiont associated. Further work will resolve whether PAUS is directly responsible for this variation in fitness or whether PAUS is incidentally associated with host-plant specialized aphid lineages.},

From theory and observational evidence, we know that variability in environmental conditions through time is likely critical to the coexistence of competing species. Nevertheless, experimental tests of fluctuation-driven coexistence are rare and have typically focused on just one of two potential mechanisms, the temporal storage effect, to the neglect of the theoretically equally plausible mechanism known as relative nonlinearity of competition. We combined experiments and simulations in a system of nectar yeasts to quantify the relative contribution of the two mechanisms to coexistence. Resource competition models parameterized from single-species assays predicted the outcomes of mixed-culture competition experiments with 83\% accuracy. Model simulations revealed that both mechanisms have measurable effects on coexistence and that relative nonlinearity can be equal or greater in magnitude to the temporal storage effect.

These results falsify the common assumption that relative nonlinearity is of negligible importance, and in doing so reveal the importance of testing coexistence mechanisms in combination.},

  abstract = {Public goods and common-pool resources are fundamental features of biological and social systems, and pose core challenges in achieving sustainability; for such situations, the immediate interests of individuals and the societies in which they are embedded are in potential conflict, involving game-theoretic considerations whose resolution need not serve the collective good. Evolution has often confronted such dilemmas--e.g., in bacterial biofilms--in the challenges of cancer, in nitrogen fixation and chelation, in the production of antibiotics, and in collective action problems across animal groups; there is much to learn from the Darwinian resolution of these situations for how to address problems our societies face today. Addressing these problems involves understanding the emergence of cooperative agreements, from reciprocal altruism and insurance arrangements to the social norms and more formal institutions that maintain societies. At the core are the issues of how individuals and societies discount the future and the interests of others, and the degree that individual decisions are influenced by regard for others. Ultimately, as Garrett Hardin suggested, the solution to problems of the commons is in "mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon," and hence in how groups of individuals form and how they arrive at decisions that ultimately benefit all.},

  abstract = {Ecological communities characteristically contain a wide diversity of species with important functional, economic and aesthetic value. Ecologists have long questioned how this diversity is maintained. Classic theory shows that stable coexistence requires competitors to differ in their niches; this has motivated numerous investigations of ecological differences presumed to maintain diversity. That niche differences are key to coexistence, however, has recently been challenged by the neutral theory of biodiversity, which explains coexistence with the equivalence of competitors. The ensuing controversy has motivated calls for a better understanding of the collective importance of niche differences for the diversity observed in ecological communities. Here we integrate theory and experimentation to show that niche differences collectively stabilize the dynamics of experimental communities of serpentine annual plants. We used field-parameterized population models to develop a null expectation for community dynamics without the stabilizing effects of niche differences. The population growth rates predicted by this null model varied by several orders of magnitude between species, which is sufficient for rapid competitive exclusion. Moreover, after two generations of community change in the field, Shannon diversity was over 50 per cent greater in communities stabilized by niche differences relative to those exhibiting dynamics predicted by the null model. Finally, in an experiment manipulating speciesg' relative abundances, population growth rates increased when species became rare\^g\texteuro "the demographic signature of niche differences. Our work thus provides strong evidence that species differences have a critical role in stabilizing species diversity. \textcopyright{} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

Neither the standard metabolic rate nor the rate of oxygen consumption during one hour of sustained, voluntary activity varied with body mass, month of the year, duration of fasting before measurement, or experimental condition (terrestrial vs aquatic). 3. Voluntary diving is not accompanied by any reduction in standard metabolic rate; these results and those of others suggest that the ``diving reflex'' of alligators is probably employed only in emergencies. 4. Spontaneous activity for one hour is accompanied by a 1.9-4.4 fold rise in oxygen consumption; this factorial increase is less than that for other reptiles induced to maximal activity for brief intervals. 5.

The genetic basis of such unique behaviors in dogs remains poorly understood. We found that genes within regions highly differentiated between outbred Chinese native dogs (CNs) and wolves show high bias for expression localized to brain tissues, particularly the prefrontal cortex, a specific region responsible for complex cognitive behaviors. In contrast, candidate genes showing high population differentiation between CNs and German Shepherd dogs (GSs) did not demonstrate significant expression bias. These observations indicate that these candidate genes highly expressed in the brain have rapidly evolved. This rapid evolution was probably driven by artificial selection during the primary transition from wolves to ancient dogs and was consistent with the evolution of dog-specific characteristics, such as behavior transformation, for thousands of years.},

  abstract = {A high energy intake rate may be important for many animals, but little is known of factors that determine intake capacity. Birds in migratory disposition presumably eat at their maximum capacity and therefore form a good model for studying the energy intake capacity of animals. We measured the maximum daily gross energy intake (GEI\textsubscript{max}) and basal metabolic rates (BMR) in 22 species of migrant passerines during autumn. Both GEI\textsubscript{max} and BMR scaled to body mass (W) close to W\textsuperscript{0.70}. More importantly, species with high GEI\textsubscript{max} for their body mass also had relatively high BMR. BMR may reflect the size of the metabolic machinery involved in energy uptake. The maximum daily metabolizable energy intake (DME\textsubscript{max}) was estimated from our GEI\textsubscript{max} data. The average ratio DME\textsubscript{max}/BMR was 4.6. In comparison, daily energy expenditure of reproducing passerines have been reported in the literature to be 3.6 times BMR. This suggests that energy intake rates may not normally limit breeding performance in passerines. Earlier studies have shown that BMR of homoeotherms reflect the rate of energy expenditure during reproduction. Our study shows that the energy intake capacity also correlates with BMR, which gives new perspectives on the ecological significance of BMR.},

  abstract = {Adaptive radiation is the process by which a single ancestral species diversifies into many descendants adapted to exploit a wide range of habitats. The appearance of ecological opportunities, or the colonisation or adaptation to novel ecological resources, has been documented to promote adaptive radiation in many classic examples. Mutualistic interactions allow species to access resources untapped by competitors, but evidence shows that the effect of mutualism on species diversification can greatly vary among mutualistic systems. Here, we test whether the development of obligate mutualism with sea anemones allowed the clownfishes to radiate adaptively across the Indian and western Pacific oceans reef habitats. We show that clownfishes morphological characters are linked with ecological niches associated with the sea anemones. This pattern is consistent with the ecological speciation hypothesis. Furthermore, the clownfishes show an increase in the rate of species diversification as well as rate of morphological evolution compared to their closest relatives without anemone mutualistic associations. The effect of mutualism on species diversification has only been studied in a limited number of groups. We present a case of adaptive radiation where mutualistic interaction is the likely key innovation, providing new insights into the mechanisms involved in the buildup of biodiversity. Due to a lack of barriers to dispersal, ecological speciation is rare in marine environments. Particular life-history characteristics of clownfishes likely reinforced reproductive isolation between populations, allowing rapid species diversification.},

We tested the refuge tactic by selecting two sets of two colonies of diamondback moth (Plutella x lostella) for resistance to B. thuringiensis subsp. ai a ai in the laboratory. In each set, one colony was selected with no refuge and the other with a 10 \% refuge from exposure to B. thuringiensis subsp. ai a ai. Bioassays conducted after nine selections were completed show that mortality caused by B. thuringiensis subsp. ai a ai was significantly greater in the refuge colonies than in the no-refuge colonies. These results demonstrate that the refuges delayed the evolution of resistance. Relative to a susceptible colony, final resistance ratios were 19 and eight for the two no-refuge colonies compared to six and five for the refuge colonies. The mean realized heritability of resistance to B. thuringiensis subsp. ai a ai was 0.046 for colonies without refuges, and k0.002 for colonies with refuges. Selection with B. thuringiensis subsp. ai a ai decreased susceptibility to B. thuringiensis toxin Cry1Ab, but not to Cry1C or B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki. Although the ultimate test of refuges will occur in the field, the experimental evidence reported here confirms modelling results indicating that refuges can slow the evolution of insect resistance to B. thuringiensis.},

SMARTdenovo (RRID: SCR\_017622) was designed to be a rapid assembler, which, unlike contemporaneous SMS assemblers, does not require highly accurate raw reads for error correction. It has performed well in the evaluation of congeneric assemblers and has been successfully users for various assembly projects. It is compatible with Canu for assembling high-quality genomes, and several of the assembly strategies in this program have been incorporated into subsequent popular assemblers. The assembler has been in use since 2015; here we provide information on the development of SMARTdenovo and how to implement its algorithms into current projects.},

We examined this interaction in a simple three-patch metacommunity and found that these two processes produce very different associations between species composition and local environment. In most conditions, we find a pattern we call "species sorting," wherein local adaptation by resident species cannot prevent invasions by other preadapted species as environmental conditions change (strong association between local environmental conditions and local community composition). When dispersal rates are very low relative to the other two rates, local adaptation by resident species predominates, leading to strong priority effects that prevent successful colonization by other species that would have been well adapted, a pattern we call "local monopolization." When dispersal and evolutionary rates are both very high, we find that an evolving species outcompetes other species in all patches, a pattern we call "global monopolization." When environmental oscillations are very frequent, local monopolization predominates. Our findings indicate that there can be strong modification of community assembly by local adaptive processes and that these depend strongly on the relative rates of evolution, dispersal, and environmental change. \textcopyright{} 2008 by The University of Chicago.

The life history, behavioural and physiological traits of some insect species may have evolved in response to these changes, allowing them to crowd on crops and to become agricultural pests. Dispersal, which is one of these traits, is a key concept in evolutionary biology but has been over-simplified in most theoretical studies. We evaluated the impact of the local-scale dispersal strategy of phytophagous insects on their fitness, using an individual-based model to simulate population dynamics and dispersal between leaves and plants, by walking and flying, of the aphid \emph{Aphis gossypii}, a major agricultural pest, in a melon field. We compared the optimal values for dispersal parameters in the model with the corresponding observed values in experimental trials. {$<$}h3{$>$}Results{$<$}/h3{$>$} We show that the rates of walking and flying disperser production on leaves were the most important traits determining the fitness criteria, whereas dispersal distance and the clustering of flying dispersers on the target plant had no effect. We further show that the effect of dispersal parameters on aphid fitness depended strongly on plant characteristics. {$<$}h3{$>$}Conclusion{$<$}/h3{$>$} Parameters defining the dispersal strategies of aphids at a local scale are key components of the fitness of these insects and may thus be essential in the adaptation to agricultural environments that are structured in space and time. Moreover, the fact that the effect of dispersal parameters on aphid fitness depends strongly on plant characteristics suggests that traits defining aphid dispersal strategies may be a cornerstone of host-plant specialization.},

The new algorithm, GeneMark-ET augments GeneMarkES with a novel method that integrates RNA-Seq read alignments into the self-training procedure. Use of `assembled' RNA-Seq transcripts is far from trivial; significant error rate of assembly was revealed in recent assessments. We demonstrated in computational experiments that the proposed method of incorporation of `unassembled' RNA-Seq reads improves the accuracy of gene prediction; particularly, for the 1.3 GB genome of Aedes aegypti the mean value of prediction Sensitivity and Specificity at the gene level increased over GeneMark-ES by 24.5\%. In the current surge of genomic data when the need for accurate sequence annotation is higher than ever, GeneMark-ET will be a valuable addition to the narrow arsenal of automatic gene prediction tools.},

SOD mRNA was expressed at even higher levels in larvae that were exposed to direct sunlight. Catalase, a small heat shock protein, Hsp70 and Hsp90 mRNAs were also strongly upregulated in response to sunlight. Total antioxidant capacity of the adults was higher than that of the larvae, but levels in both stages of the midge were much higher than observed in a freeze-tolerant, temperate zone insect, the gall fly Eurosta solidaginis.

Temporal overlap and difference between consumer efficiencies play roles that are in general qualitatively similar to those of niche overlap and difference between carrying capacities in the classical theory of competition in a constant environment.

One of the best-studied examples involves Caribbean "Anolis "lizards. With about 400 species, "Anolis "has played an important role in the development of ecological theory and has become a model system exemplifying the integration of ecological, evolutionary, and behavioral studies to understand evolutionary diversification. This major work, written by one of the best-known investigators of "Anolis, "reviews and synthesizes an immense literature. Jonathan B.

Wilson's The Theory of Island Biogeography, first published by Princeton in 1967, is one of the most influential books on ecology and evolution to appear in the past half century. By developing a general mathematical theory to explain a crucial ecological problem--the regulation of species diversity in island populations--the book transformed the science of biogeography and ecology as a whole. In The Theory of Island Biogeography Revisited, some of today's most prominent biologists assess the continuing impact of MacArthur and Wilson's book four decades after its publication. Following an opening chapter in which Wilson reflects on island biogeography in the 1960s, fifteen chapters evaluate and demonstrate how the field has extended and confirmed--as well as challenged and modified--MacArthur and Wilson's original ideas. Providing a broad picture of the fundamental ways in which the science of island biogeography has been shaped by MacArthur and Wilson's landmark work, The Theory of Island Biogeography Revisited also points the way toward exciting future research.},

  abstract = {Recent work on facilitative plant\textendash plant interactions has emphasized the importance of neighbours' amelioration of abiotic stress, but the facilitative effects of neighbours in reducing plant apparency to herbivores have received less attention. Whereas theory on stress reduction predicts that competition should be more important in less stressful conditions, with facilitation becoming more important in harsh environments, apparency theory suggests that facilitation should be greater in the presence of herbivores, where it is disadvantageous to be conspicuous regardless of abiotic stress level. We tested the relative strength of neighbours' stress reduction versus apparency reduction on survival, growth, reproduction and lifetime fitness of Hibiscus meyeri , a common forb in central Kenya, using neighbour removals conducted inside and outside large-herbivore exclosures replicated in arid and mesic sites. In the absence of herbivores, neighbours competed with H. meyeri in mesic areas and facilitated H. meyeri in arid areas, as predicted by stress-reduction mechanisms. By contrast, neighbours facilitated H. meyeri in the presence of herbivory, regardless of aridity level, consistent with plant apparency. Our results show that the facilitative effects arising from plant apparency are stronger than the effects arising from abiotic stress reduction in this system, suggesting that plant-apparency effects may be particularly important in systems with extant large-herbivore communities.},

Despite an accumulation of evidence that mothers can sex-specifically modulate investment in offspring in relation to maternal quality, few mechanisms have been proposed as to how this is achieved. We explored a hormonal mechanism for sex-biased maternal investment by measuring and experimentally manipulating baseline levels of the stress hormone corticosterone in laying wild female European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and examining effects on sex ratio and sex-specific offspring phenotype adjustment. Here we show that baseline plasma corticosterone is negatively correlated with energetic body condition in laying starlings, and subsequent experimental elevation of maternal baseline plasma corticosterone increased yolk corticosterone without altering maternal condition or egg quality per se. Hormonal elevation resulted in the following: female-biased hatching sex ratios (caused by elevated male embryonic mortality), lighter male offspring at hatching (which subsequently grew more slowly during postnatal development), and lower cell-mediated immune (phytohemagglutinin) responses in males compared with control-born males; female offspring were unaffected by the manipulation in both years of the study. Elevated maternal corticosterone therefore resulted in a sex-biased adjustment of offspring quality favorable to female offspring via both a sex ratio bias and a modulation of male phenotype at hatching. In birds, deposition of yolk corticosterone may benefit mothers by acting as a bet-hedging strategy in stochastic environments where the correlation between environmental cues at laying (and therefore potentially maternal condition) and conditions during chick-rearing might be low and unpredictable. Together with recent studies in other vertebrate taxa, these results suggest that maternal stress hormones provide a mechanistic link between maternal quality and sex-biased maternal investment in offspring.},

  abstract = {Many animals exhibit behavioural syndromes-consistent individual differences in behaviour across two or more contexts or situations. Here, we present adaptive, state-dependent mathematical models for analysing issues about behavioural syndromes. We find that asset protection (where individuals with more 'assets' tend be more cautious) and starvation avoidance, two state-dependent mechanisms, can explain short-term behavioural consistency, but not long-term stable behavioural types (BTs). These negative-feedback mechanisms tend to produce convergence in state and behaviour over time. In contrast, a positive-feedback mechanism, state-dependent safety (where individuals with higher energy reserves, size, condition or vigour are better at coping with predators), can explain stable differences in personality over the long term. The relative importance of negative- and positive-feedback mechanisms in governing behavioural consistency depends on environmental conditions (predation risk and resource availability). Behavioural syndromes emerge more readily in conditions of intermediate ecological favourability (e.g. medium risk and medium resources, or high risk and resources, or low risk and resources). Under these conditions, individuals with higher initial state maintain a tendency to be bolder than individuals that start with low initial state; i.e. later BT is determined by state during an early 'developmental window'. In contrast, when conditions are highly favourable (low risk, high resources) or highly unfavourable (high risk, low resources), individuals converge to be all relatively bold or all relatively cautious, respectively. In those circumstances, initial differences in BT are not maintained over the long term, and there is no early developmental window where initial state governs later BT. The exact range of ecological conditions favouring behavioural syndromes depends also on the strength of state-dependent safety.},

  abstract = {One of the great unsolved mysteries of evolutionary biology concerns the genetic mechanisms underlying the origin of genomic incompatibilities between species. Two prevailing thoughts are that such incompatibilities often result from epistatically interacting genes that act as loss-of-function alleles in hybrid backgrounds or from chromosomal rearrangements that result in mis-segregation during meiosis in hybrids. However, it is unclear how genes that cause a radical breakdown in hybrids arise without reducing fitness within species, and numerous cases of speciation appear to be unassociated with obvious chromosomal rearrangements. Here we suggest that duplicate genes, and more generally any kind of genomic redundancies, provide a powerful substrate for the origin of genomic incompatibilities in isolated populations. The divergent resolution of genomic redundancies, such that one population loses function from one copy while the second population loses function from a second copy at a different chromosomal location, leads to chromosomal repatterning such that gametes produced by hybrid individuals can be completely lacking in functional genes for a duplicate pair. Under this model, incompatibility factors accumulate with essentially no loss of fitness within populations as postulated under the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller (BDM) model of speciation and despite the fact that they arise from degenerative mutations. However, unlike the situation often envisioned under the BDM model, no change in the mode of gene action in hybrid backgrounds need be invoked. The plausibility of this model derives from a number of recent observations, including the fact that most genomes harbor substantial numbers of gene duplicates whose turnover is common and ongoing process and the fact that many genes have complex regulatory regions that facilitate their divergent resolution in sister taxa.},

The changes include gradual increases in gene number, resulting from the retention of duplicate genes, and more abrupt increases in the abundance of spliceosomal introns and mobile genetic elements. We argue that many of these modifications emerged passively in response to the long-term population-size reductions that accompanied increases in organism size. According to this model, much of the restructuring of eukaryotic genomes was initiated by nonadaptive processes, and this in turn provided novel substrates for the secondary evolution of phenotypic complexity by natural selection. The enormous long-term effective population sizes of prokaryotes may impose a substantial barrier to the evolution of complex genomes and morphologies.},

Generally, due to negative consequences of prolonged elevation of glucocorticoids, animals should have a transient stress response just sufficient to cope with the stressor. In rodents, stress responsiveness is affected by early developmental experience, and hyper-responsiveness to stress is linked to morbidity and mortality. We assessed individual variation in stress responses in free-living song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, in relation to fitness-related measures including song and overwinter survival. Birds with greater increases in corticosterone 30 min following restraint stress were less likely to return to breed the following year. Stress responsiveness was also correlated with song complexity: males with fewer syllables in their song repertoires had greater stress reactivity. Our findings support the hypothesis that developmental stressors both impair song development and affect the adult stress response. Thus, individual variation in the stress response may relate to variation in fitness.},

  abstract = {Few invaded ecosystems are free from habitat loss and disturbance, leading to uncertainty whether dominant invasive species are driving community change or are passengers along for the environmental ride. The "driver" model predicts that invaded communities are highly interactive, with subordinate native species being limited or excluded by competition from the exotic dominants. The "passenger" model predicts that invaded communities are primarily structured by noninteractive factors (environmental change, dispersal limitation) that are less constraining on the exotics, which thus dominate. We tested these alternative hypotheses in an invaded, fragmented, and fire-suppressed oak savanna. We examined the impact of two invasive dominant perennial grasses on community structure using a reduction (mowing of aboveground biomass) and removal (weeding of above- and belowground biomass) experiment conducted at different seasons and soil depths. We examined the relative importance of competition vs. dispersal limitation with experimental seed additions. Competition by the dominants limits the abundance and reproduction of many native and exotic species based on their increased performance with removals and mowing. The treatments resulted in increased light availability and bare soil; soil moisture and N were unaffected. Although competition was limiting for some, 36 of 79 species did not respond to the treatments or declined in the absence of grass cover. Seed additions revealed that some subordinates are dispersal limited; competition alone was insufficient to explain their rarity even though it does exacerbate dispersal inefficiencies by lowering reproduction. While the net effects of the dominants were negative, their presence restricted woody plants, facilitated seedling survival with moderate disturbance (i.e., treatments applied in the fall), or was not the primary limiting factor for the occurrence of some species. Finally, the species most functionally distinct from the dominants (forbs, woody plants) responded most significantly to the treatments. This suggests that relative abundance is determined more by trade-offs relating to environmental conditions (long-term fire suppression) than to traits relating to resource capture (which should most impact functionally similar species). This points toward the passenger model as the underlying cause of exotic dominance, although their combined effects (suppressive and facilitative) on community structure are substantial.},

In particular, researchers interested in functional biology and adaptation have used these technologies to sequence mRNA transcriptomes of specific tissues, which in turn are often compared to other tissues, or other individuals with different phenotypes. While these techniques are extremely powerful, careful attention to data quality is required. In particular, because high-throughput sequencing is more error-prone than traditional Sanger sequencing, quality trimming of sequence reads should be an important step in all data processing pipelines. While several software packages for quality trimming exist, no general guidelines for the specifics of trimming have been developed. Here, using empirically derived sequence data, I provide general recommendations regarding the optimal strength of trimming, specifically in mRNA-Seq studies. Although very aggressive quality trimming is common, this study suggests that a more gentle trimming, specifically of those nucleotides whose PHRED score {$<$}2 or {$<$}5, is optimal for most studies across a wide variety of metrics.},

These novel interactions also may provoke rapid evolutionary responses and can be ideal scenarios for investigating how species interactions influence plant evolution. To explore how mutualists influence the evolution of colonizing plant populations, we capitalized on an experiment in which two former agricultural fields were seeded with identical prairie seed mixes in 2010. Six years later, we compared how populations of the legumeChamaecrista fasciculatafrom these sites and their original (shared) source population responded to nitrogen-fixing rhizobia from the restoration sites in a greenhouse reciprocal cross-inoculation experiment. We found that the two populations differed both from their original source population and from each other in the benefits they derive from rhizobia, and that one population has evolved reduced allocation to rhizobia (i.e. forms fewer rhizobium-housing nodules). Synthesis. Our results suggest that these plant populations have evolved different ways of interacting with rhizobia, potentially in response to differences in rhizobium quality between sites. Our study illustrates how microbial mutualists may shape plant evolution in new environments and highlights how variation in microbial mutualists potentially may select for different evolutionary strategies in plant hosts.},

We use large-scale genomic and phenotypic analysis to identify the extent of diversification in controlled experimental populations and apply these data to differentiate between several potential mechanisms of evolutionary divergence. We defined testable differences between five proposed mechanisms and used experimental evolution studies to follow eight glucose-limited Escherichia coli chemostat populations at two growth rates. Simple phenotypic tests identified 11 phenotype combinations evolving under glucose limitation. Each evolved population exhibited 3 to 5 different combinations of the 11 phenotypic clusters. Genome sequencing of a representative of each phenotypic cluster from each population identified 193 mutations in 48 isolates. Only two of the 48 strains had evolved identically. Convergent paths to the same phenotype occurred, but two pleiotropic mutations were unique to slow-growing bacteria, permitting them greater phenotypic variance. Indeed, greater diversity arose in slower-growing, more stressed cultures. Mutation accumulation, hypermutator presence and fitness mechanisms varied between and within populations, with the evolved fitness considerably more uniform with fast growth cultures. Negative frequency-dependent fitness was shown by a subset of isolates. Evolutionary diversity is unlikely to be explained by any one of the available mechanisms. For a large population as used in this study, our results suggest that multiple mechanisms contribute to the mix of phenotypes and evolved fitness types in a diversifying population. Another major conclusion is that the capacity of a population to diversify is a function of growth rate.},

  abstract = {Patterns of biodiversity are often explained by ecological processes, where traits that promote novel ways of interacting with the environment (key innovations) play a fundamental role in promoting diversification. However, sexual selection and social competition can also promote diversification through rapid evolution of ornamental traits. Because selection can operate only on existing variation, the tendency of ornamental traits to constrain or enable the production of novel phenotypes is a crucial but often overlooked aspect of diversification. Starlings are a speciose group characterized by diverse iridescent colors produced by nanometer-scale arrays of melanin-containing organelles (melanosomes) that play a central role in sexual selection and social competition. We show that evolutionary lability of these colors is associated with both morphological and lineage diversification in African starlings. The solid rod-like melanosome morphology has evolved in a directional manner into three more optically complex forms that can produce a broader range of colors than the ancestral form, resulting in (i) faster color evolution, (ii) the occupation of novel, previously unreachable regions of colorspace, and ultimately (iii) accelerated lineage diversification. As in adaptive radiations, key innovations in ornament production can provide high phenotypic trait variability, leading to dramatic effects on the tempo and mode of diversification.},

In this concise book, you'll make your functions pure by avoiding side-effects; you'll write functions that manipulate other functions, and you'll construct complex functions using simpler functions as building blocks. In Functional Programming in R, you'll see how we can replace loops, which can have side-effects, with recursive functions that can more easily avoid them. In addition, the book covers why you shouldn't use recursion when loops are more efficient and how you can get the best of both worlds. Functional programming is a style of programming, like object-oriented programming, but one that focuses on data transformations and calculations rather than objects and state. Where in object-oriented programming you model your programs by describing which states an object can be in and how methods will reveal or modify that state, in functional programming you model programs by describing how functions translate input data to output data. Functions themselves are considered to be data you can manipulate and much of the strength of functional programming comes from manipulating functions; that is, building more complex functions by combining simpler functions. What You'll Learn Write functions in R including infix operators and replacement functions Create higher order functions Pass functions to other functions and start using functions as data you can manipulate Use Filer, Map and Reduce functions to express the intent behind code clearly and safely Build new functions from existing functions without necessarily writing any new functions, using point-free programming Create functions that carry data along with them Who This Book Is For Those with at least some experience with programming in R.},

  abstract = {Methods for evaluating the quality of genomic and metagenomic data are essential to aid genome assembly procedures and to correctly interpret the results of subsequent analyses. BUSCO estimates the completeness and redundancy of processed genomic data based on universal single-copy orthologs. Here, we present new functionalities and major improvements of the BUSCO software, as well as the renewal and expansion of the underlying data sets in sync with the OrthoDB v10 release. Among the major novelties, BUSCO now enables phylogenetic placement of the input sequence to automatically select the most appropriate BUSCO data set for the assessment, allowing the analysis of metagenomeassembled genomes of unknown origin. A newly introduced genome workflow increases the efficiency and runtimes especially on large eukaryotic genomes. BUSCO is the only tool capable of assessing both eukaryotic and prokaryotic species, and can be applied to various data types, from genome assemblies and metagenomic bins, to transcriptomes and gene sets.},

  abstract = {Exotic plants often face different conditions from those experienced where they are native. The general issue of how exotics respond to unfamiliar environments within their new range is not well understood. Phenotypic plasticity has historically been seen as the primary. mechanism enabling exotics to colonize large, environmentally diverse areas. However, new work indicates that exotics can evolve quickly, suggesting that contemporary evolution may be more important in invasion ecology than previously appreciated. To determine the influence of contemporary evolution; phenotypic plasticity, and founder effects in affecting phenotypic variation among introduced plants, we compared the size, fecundity, and leaf area of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) collected from native European and introduced western and central North American populations in common gardens in Washington, California, Spain, and Sweden. We also determined genetic relationships among these plants by examining variation in amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. There was substantial genetic variation among introduced populations and evidence for multiple introductions of H. perforatum into North America. Across common gardens introduced plants were neither universally larger nor more fecund than natives. However, within common gardens, both introduced and native populations exhibited significant latitudinally based clines in size and fecundity. Clines among introduced populations broadly converged with those among native populations. Introduced and native plants originating from northern latitudes generally outperformed those originating from southern latitudes when grown in northern latitude gardens of Washington and Sweden. Conversely, plants from southern latitudes performed best in southern gardens in Spain and California. Clinal patterns in leaf area, however, did not change between gardens; European and central North American plants from northern latitudes had larger leaves than plants from southern latitudes within these regions in both Washington and California, the two gardens where this trait was measured. Introduced plants did not always occur at similar latitudes as their most closely related native progenitor, indicating that pre-adaptation (i.e., climate matching) is unlikely to be the sole explanation for clinal patterns among introduced populations. Instead, results suggest that introduced plants are evolving adaptations to broad-scale environmental conditions in their introduced range.},

  abstract = {More than five decades ago, Ehrlich and Raven proposed a revolutionary idea-that the evolution of novel plant defense could spur adaptive radiation in plants. Despite motivating much work on plant-herbivore coevolution and defense theory, Ehrlich and Raven never proposed a mechanism for their "escape and radiate" model. Recent intriguing mechanisms proposed by Marquis et al. include sympatric divergence, pleiotropic effects of plant defense traits on reproductive isolation, and strong postzygotic isolation, but these may not be general features of herbivore-mediated speciation. An alternate view is that herbivores may impose strong divergent selection on defenses in allopatric plant populations, with plant-herbivore coevolution driving local adaptation resulting in plant speciation. Building on these ideas, we propose three scenarios that consider the role of herbivores in plant speciation. These include (1) vicariance, subsequent coevolution within populations and adaptive divergence between geographically isolated populations, (2) colonization of a new habitat lacking effective herbivores followed by loss of defense and then re-evolution and coevolution of defense in response to novel herbivores, and (3) evolution of a new defense followed by range expansion, vicariance, and coevolution. We discuss the general role of coevolution in plant speciation and consider outstanding issues related to understanding: (1) the mechanisms behind cospeciation of plants and insects, (2) geographic variation in defense phenotypes, (3) how defensive traits and geography map on plant phylogenies, and (4) the role of herbivores in driving character displacement in defense phenotypes of related species in sympatry.},

Despite the lack of discussion in recent times, the usage of symbiosis has evolved and appears to be stabilizing to broader interpretations. Current usage of symbiosis and its associated terminology in 10 current general biology (GB) and 10 general ecology (GE) textbooks is presented. The restrictive definition (i.e. symbiosis = mutualism) has essentially disappeared. All GB textbooks (100\%) surveyed used an explicit or implicit ``de Bary'' definition of symbiosis (i.e. mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism), while only 40\% of GE textbooks did the same. General ecology textbooks also included 30\% defining symbiosis to constitute all species interactions and 30\% that completely avoided usage of the term. When combining GB and GE textbooks to analyze symbiotic usage, 85\% defined mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism as symbiotic interactions. Also, 70\% considered a symbiosis to be a species interaction that is ``intimate,'' with 45\% of those both ``intimate and constant.'' Unfortunately, only 5\% used the terms ecto -/ endosymbiosis , which help discern intimacy and constancy in species interactions. Usage of symbiont (55\%) was preferred over symbiote (0\%). Predator and prey were defined as organisms (vs. animals) in 90\% of GB and GE textbooks, while 55\% and 75\% described carnivores and herbivores as organisms, respectively. Only 25\% discussed predation, parasitism, parasitoidism, and grazing/herbivory, with only one (5\%) integrating these +/- agonistic interactions in relation to intimacy and lethality. Data reveals trend of biologists/ecologists using broader definitions.},

  abstract = {Although heritable microorganisms are increasingly recognized as widespread in insects, no systematic screens for such symbionts have been conducted in Drosophila species (the primary insect genetic models for studies of evolution, development, and innate immunity). Previous efforts screened relatively few Drosophila lineages, mainly for Wolbachia. We conducted an extensive survey of potentially heritable endosymbionts from any bacterial lineage via PCR screens of mature ovaries in 181 recently collected fly strains representing 35 species from 11 species groups. Due to our fly sampling methods, however, we are likely to have missed fly strains infected with sex ratio-distorting endosymbionts. Only Wolbachia and Spiroplasma, both widespread in insects, were confirmed as symbionts. These findings indicate that in contrast to some other insect groups, other heritable symbionts are uncommon in Drosophila species, possibly reflecting a robust innate immune response that eliminates many bacteria. A more extensive survey targeted these two symbiont types through diagnostic PCR in 1225 strains representing 225 species from 32 species groups. Of these, 19 species were infected by Wolbachia while only 3 species had Spiroplasma. Several new strains of Wolbachia and Spiroplasma were discovered, including ones divergent from any reported to date. The phylogenetic distribution of Wolbachia and Spiroplasma in Drosophila is discussed.},

  abstract = {We investigate the effect of changing the population size of one predator species on the fitness of another predator when both share a common prey species. The prey is assumed to have different anti-predator behaviors for each predator. Anti-predator behavior can result in one or both predators having positive effects on the fitness of the other. Positive short-term effects (on a behavioral time scale) can be produced by three mechanisms: (1) A behavior that defends against one predator may make the prey more vulnerable to the other; (2) Increased defensive behavior against one predator may increase the cost of defense against the other, resulting in a reduction in the latter defense; (3) If the prey constantly employs some anti-predator behavior, an increase in one behavior can only come at the expense of a reduction in another. The long-term effect of one predator on another is more likely to be negative than is the short-term effect, due to reduction in prey density. However, a strongly positive short-term effect and a prey population that is weakly affected by predator density, can produce a positive long-term effect. Even when both short- and long-term interactions between predators are competitive, the prey's behavior often reduces the ratio of inter- to intra-specific competition between the two predators, promoting their coexistence.},

Notably, Mayr explains that Darwin's theory of evolution is actually five separate theories, each with its own history, trajectory and impact. Natural selection is a separate idea from common descent, and from geographic speciation, and so on. A number of the perennial Darwinian controversies may well have been caused by the confounding of the five separate theories into a single composite. Those interested in evolutionary theory, or the philosophy and history of science will find useful ideas in this book, which should appeal to virtually anyone with a broad curiosity about biology.},

  abstract = {Alligators and crocodiles integrate biological impacts of hydrological operations, affecting them at all life stages through three key aspects of Everglades ecology: (1) food webs, (2) diversity and productivity, and (3) freshwater flow. Responses of crocodilians are directly related to suitability of environmental conditions and hydrologic change. Correlations between biological responses and environmental conditions contribute to an understand- ing of species' status and trends over time. Positive or negative trends of crocodilian populations relative to hydrologic changes permit assessment of positive or negative trends in restoration. The crocodilian indicator uses monitoring parameters (performance measures) that have been shown to be both effective and efficient in tracking trends. The alligator component uses relative density (reported as an encounter rate), body condition, and occupancy rates of alligator holes; the crocodile component uses juvenile growth and hatchling survival. We hypothesize that these parameters are correlated with hydrologic conditions including depth, duration, timing, spatial extent and water quality. Salinity is a critical parameter in estuarine habitats. Assessments of parameters defined for crocodilian performance measures support these hypotheses. Alligators and crocodiles are the charismatic megafauna of the Everglades. They are both keystone and flagship species to which the public can relate. In addition, the parameters used to track trends are easy to understand. They provide answers to the following questions: How has the number of alligators or crocodiles changed? Are the animals fatter or thinner than they should be? Are the animals in the places (in terms of habitat and geography) where they should be? As surely as there is no other Everglades, no other single species defines the Everglades as does the American alligator. The Everglades is the only place in the world where both alligators and crocodiles exist. Crocodilians clearly respond to changes in hydrologic parameters of management interest. These relationships are easy to communicate and mean something to managers, decision makers, and the public. Having crocodilians on the list of system-wide, general indicators provides us with one of the most powerful tools we have to communicate progress of ecosystem restoration in Greater Everglades ecosystems to diverse audiences.},

Evidence linking pythons to mammal declines has been indirect and there are reasons to question whether pythons, or any predator, could have caused the precipitous declines seen across a range of mammalian functional groups. Experimentally manipulating marsh rabbits, we found that pythons accounted for 77\% of rabbit mortalities within 11 months of their translocation to ENP and that python predation appeared to preclude the persistence of rabbit populations in ENP. On control sites, outside of the park, no rabbits were killed by pythons and 71\% of attributable marsh rabbit mortalities were classified as mammal predations. Burmese pythons pose a serious threat to the faunal communities and ecological functioning of the Greater Everglades Ecosystem, which will probably spread as python populations expand their range.},

  abstract = {One of the most ubiquitous and omnipresent environmental challenges faced by animals is that of food limitation. Interestingly, some animals appear better suited to successfully tolerate prolonged periods of starvation. Snakes are among the few vertebrate animals that are known to survive periods of starvation in excess of two years, and thus provide an excellent model in which to investigate some of the physiological adaptations that permit their extraordinary ability to tolerate starvation. The purpose of my dissertation research was to [1] compare the responses to starvation exhibited by snakes with those documented among other animals and [2] characterize potentially adaptive mechanisms that permit snakes to survive comparatively extreme bouts of starvation. To explore these questions, I conducted three rounds of starvation experiments employing six distantly-related reptile species (i.e. Crotalus atrox, Elaphe obsoleta, Python regius, Boa constrictor, Bitis gabonica, and Varanus exanthematicus). My experiments led to several novel findings about how reptiles respond to starvation. Among the most unanticipated observations revealed by this research was that starving subadult, snakes [1] are capable of starvation-induced hypometabolic responses, [2] undergo increases in their snout-vent-length, and [3] employ various strategies for regulating circulating physiological fuels. My experiments have also allowed me to identify other physiological responses to starvation including changes in fatty acid profiles and tissue isotope composition that might ultimately be useful for studying nutritional stress among reptiles generally.},

Thus, an examination into structural racism in STEM is needed to expose the marginalization of underrepresented groups in STEM and to improve understanding of the STEM policies, practices, and procedures that allow the foundation of racism to remain intact. I argue that, even at the top of the education hierarchy, Black STEM doctorate students and PhD degree holders consistently endure the racist residue of higher education institutions and STEM employers. Thus, this manuscript also discusses how universities institutionalize diversity mentoring programs designed mostly to fix (read ``assimilate'') underrepresented students of color while ignoring or minimizing the role of the STEM departments in creating racially hostile work and educational spaces. I argue that, without a critical examination of the structural racism omnipresent in the STEM, progress in racially diversifying STEM will continue at a snail's pace.},

  abstract = {Recent research has shown that the bacterial endosymbionts of insects are abundant and diverse, and that they have numerous different effects on their hosts' biology. Here we explore how insect endosymbionts might affect the structure and dynamics of insect communities. Using the obligate and facultative symbionts of aphids as an example, we find that there are multiple ways that symbiont presence might affect food web structure. Many symbionts are now known to help their hosts escape or resist natural enemy attack, and others can allow their hosts to withstand abiotic stress or affect host plant use. In addition to the direct effect of symbionts on aphid phenotypes there may be indirect effects mediated through trophic and non-trophic community interactions. We believe that by using data from barcoding studies to identify bacterial symbionts, this extra, microbial dimension to insect food webs can be better elucidated.

The rapid development of genomic methods has posed an important question, namely where do genetics and genomics sit in relation to their application in the conservation of species? Although genetics can answer a number of relevant questions related to conservation, the argument for the application of genomics is not yet fully exploited. Here, we explore the transition and rationale for the move from genetic to genomic research in conservation biology and the utility of such research. We explore the idea of a 'conservation prior' and how this can be determined by genomic data and used in the management of populations. We depict three different conservation scenarios and describe how genomic data can drive management action in each situation. We conclude that the most effective applications of genomics will be to inform stakeholders with the aim of avoiding 'emergency room conservation'.},

However, Bayesian relaxed-clock approaches frequently used to infer these timetrees impose a large computational burden and discourage critical assessment of the robustness of inferred times to model assumptions, influence of calibrations, and selection of optimal data subsets. We analyzed eight large, recently published, empirical datasets to compare time estimates produced by RelTime (a non-Bayesian method) with those reported by using Bayesian approaches. We find that RelTime estimates are very similar to Bayesian approaches, yet RelTime requires orders of magnitude less computational time. This means that the use of RelTime will enable greater rigor in molecular dating, because faster computational speeds encourage more extensive testing of the robustness of inferred timetrees to prior assumptions (models and calibrations) and data subsets. Thus, RelTime provides a reliable and computationally thrifty approach for dating the tree of life using large-scale molecular datasets.},

We performed forward simulations under realistic gene-structure and selection scenarios to investigate whether such linkage effects impinge on the ability of the McDonald\textendash Kreitman (MK) test to infer the rate of positive selection (\emph{{$\alpha$}}) from polymorphism and divergence data. We find that in the presence of slightly deleterious mutations, MK estimates of \emph{{$\alpha$}} severely underestimate the true rate of adaptation even if all polymorphisms with population frequencies under 50\% are excluded. Furthermore, already under intermediate rates of adaptation, genetic draft substantially distorts the site frequency spectra at neutral and functional sites from the expectations under mutation\textendash selection\textendash drift balance. MK-type approaches that first infer demography from synonymous sites and then use the inferred demography to correct the estimation of {$\alpha$} obtain almost the correct {$\alpha$} in our simulations. However, these approaches typically infer a severe past population expansion although there was no such expansion in the simulations, casting doubt on the accuracy of methods that infer demography from synonymous polymorphism data. We propose a simple asymptotic extension of the MK test that yields accurate estimates of {$\alpha$} in our simulations and should provide a fruitful direction for future studies.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Beginners in life history theory or evolutionary ecology seemingly face a variety of almost unrelated approaches. Yet the biomathematical fiterature of the last 1 O-20 years reflects the implicit acceptance of a common evolutionary frameworli, the core idea 6eing that there exists a unique general fitness measure that concisely summarizes the overall time course of potential invasions 6y initially mre mutant phenotypes. Using such an invasion criterion to characterize fitness implicitly presupposes a scenario in which, during periods of clear evolutionary change, the rate of evolution is set primarily by the random occurrence (and initial estublish-ment) of fuvourable mutations. Evol-utionarily stable life history strategies (ESSs) may then 6e regarded as traps for the evolutionary random wulk. Three recent books'-3 and one survey papep provide a comprehensive introduction to the mathematical machinery for dealing with the population consequences of complicated life histories and/or ecological scenarios. Our aim here is to sketch the implied evolutionary framework in bare outline, with a minimum of technical detail yet with reference to nontrivial examples. In particular, we note that although there is no general sense in which evolution 'maximizes fitness', under various simplifying assumptions many of the special optimization criteria that can be found in the literature may be derived from invasibility considerations. Later in the article we elaborate a little on the theme of the evolutionary random walk, concentrating in particular on the nature of the 'evolutionary attractors'. We conclude with some remarks concerning alternative genetic scenarios, and possible wider applications of the formalism. The simplest selection model 198 on a number of assumptions: one locus with two alleles (say a and A), no (further) mutations, random mating, non-overlapping generations , differential survival prior to reproduction ('viability') as the only selective force, and fully constant relative individual viabilities. Invasion by A into a population made up of aa homozygotes is possible if (and effectively only if) the viability of the heterozygote aA exceeds that of the resident homozygotes. Let the difference between the logarithms of the heterozygote and resident homozygote viabilities be denoted as s,(A). This 'selection coefficient' equals the initial relative growth rate of the mutant frequency, after the initial hurdle of potential random extinction has been overcome. An aa population can be invaded by an A mutant if (and again effectively only if) s,(A) is positive. We can immediately extend this result to temporally variable environments that affect only the viabilities, whether cyclical, random or chaotic, provided we define s,(A) to be the time average of the previously defined stepwise selection coefficients, which now take a different value at each time step. Provided there are no longlasting environmental trends, this time average is independent of the starting moment, or the replicate (if we are dealing with stochastic environments). Then the selection coefficient can be interpreted as the difference between the long-run (logarithmic) growth rates of the invader and the resident population. Population dynamics in variable environments The foregoing observations can be extended in principle to more complicated ecological scenarios, the only proviso being that we may neglect the possibility of long-term (or preferential) interactions among individuals. The essential point is that the dynamics of an invader can be represented by linear equations, possibly with time-varying coefficients. In this section we discuss the rudiments of the theory of linear population equations, concentrating on finite dimensional discrete time models. The extension to infinitely many dimensions and/or continuous time involves some care with definitions, replacement of the word 'matrix' with 'linear operator", a lot of hard mathematical work, but no new biological ideas. Consider a population, the individual members of which may be found in an finite number of 'i-states' representing physiological differences (for example in age, size or nutritional status) and/or 'x-states' representing spatial location. The 'h-state' (meaning heterogeneity) of an individual is the combination of its i-and x-state. The population at time t is described by a vector N(t) which has for its components the densities of the individuals in each h-state. We can denote the total population size as 1 N(t)l. What happens to an individual, whether it migrates, changes i-state, gives birth or dies, depends in a probabilistic manner on its own h-state and on the overall condition of the environment E(t), and on nothing else. Here E(t) is a vector with quantities like the temperature, predation pressure, etc. at the different localities as components. Assume now that the environmental process shows no longlasting trend. The so-called multiplicative ergodic theorem tells us that under very general conditions3 the relative sizes of the components of N eventually become independent of N(O). It also tells us that the long-run growth rate, which can be defined as the limiting value, as (time) T approaches infinity, of the quantity T-'\{ln(N(T)(-InlN(O)(\} (3) is a fixed number. This number, which we denote by s because of the},

The few genes under or physically linked to loci experiencing strong disruptive selection can diverge, whereas gene flow will homogenize the remainder of the genome, resulting in isolated ``genomic islands of speciation.'' We conducted an experimental test of this hypothesis in \emph{Rhagoletis pomonella}, a model for sympatric ecological speciation. Contrary to expectations, we found widespread divergence throughout the \emph{Rhagoletis} genome, with the majority of loci displaying host differences, latitudinal clines, associations with adult eclosion time, and within-generation responses to selection in a manipulative overwintering experiment. The latter two results, coupled with linkage disequilibrium analyses, provide experimental evidence that divergence was driven by selection on numerous independent genomic regions rather than by genome-wide genetic drift. ``Continents'' of multiple differentiated loci, rather than isolated islands of divergence, may characterize even the early stages of speciation. Our results also illustrate how these continents can exhibit variable topography, depending on selection strength, availability of preexisting genetic variation, linkage relationships, and genomic features that reduce recombination. For example, the divergence observed throughout the \emph{Rhagoletis} genome was clearly accentuated in some regions, such as those harboring chromosomal inversions. These results highlight how the individual genes driving speciation can be embedded within an actively diverging genome.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The raising of f H, as the surface of a heliothermic reptile warms, increases cardiac output and facilitates in optimising the preferred daily body temperature (PDBT). In mammals, the fine tuning of cardiac output by the autonomic system can be observed through distinct oscillatory patterns in f H. This study examined Caiman latirostris (n = 6) to determine if similar oscillations in f H were present, and to assess if they exhibited a diurnal component associated with daily shifts in body temperature. A surgically implanted miniature datalogger recorded every heart beat and the dorsal surface temperature (Tds) of animals free-ranging in a semi-natural habitat. All C. latirostris exhibited rapid warming of Tds between 0700 and 1200. This was correlated with a rapid increase in f H, accompanied by erratic beat-to-beat oscillations in instantaneous f H. As Tds cooled, f H decreased and the short-term oscillations were abolished, resulting in a much slower rate of change in instantaneous f H. The two distinct f H rhythms may serve to optimise the PDBT over the diurnal cycle.},

We develop a framework for understanding the joint influence of these processes in changing the mean and variance of expansion speed and its underlying traits. Our synthesis of recent laboratory experiments supports the consistent role of evolution in accelerating expansion speed on average, and highlights unexpected diversity in how evolution can influence variability in speed: results not well predicted by current theory. We discuss and evaluate support for three classes of modifiers of eco-evolutionary range dynamics (landscape context, trait genetics, and biotic interactions), identify emerging themes, and suggest new directions for future work in a field that stands to increase in relevance as populations move in response to global change.},

In the chicks, the body weight, whole body lipid and moisture content and relation of tissue and organ weights to the body weight changed with growth, especially with flapping and flying activity. In the adults, body weight, whole body lipid and moisture content fluctuated widely owing to migration and breeding; the relation- ship of tissue and organ weights to the body weight was nearly constant through the period. The chicks fed mainly on loaches in addition to frogs and insects; the size of the loaches eaten by the chicks increased as they grew, indicating that the more the chicks grew, the larger fishes they selected.},

As a result, plasticity alters numerous interactions between organisms and their abiotic and biotic environments. Although much work on plasticity has focused on its patterns of expression and evolution, researchers are increasingly interested in understanding how plasticity can affect ecological patterns and processes at various levels. Here, we highlight an expanding body of work that examines how plasticity can affect all levels of ecological organization through effects on demographic parameters, direct and indirect species interactions, such as competition, predation, and coexistence, and ultimately carbon and nutrient cycles. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in Florida lakes have been associated with decreased egg hatchability and increased developmental mortality in American Alligators (Alligator mississippiensis). Although concentrations of specific OCPs in yolk do not correlate with egg hatchability and hatchling survivability, a complex mixture of OCPs may decrease egg and embryo quality by altering maternal reproductive function. Vitellogenin (Vtg), a follicular precursor protein has long been described as a biomarker of endocrine disruption in other oviparous species. However, there is no documentation in the literature of a definitive test for identifying and measuring Vtg in this species. This is because of the inter-species variability in the amino acid sequence of this protein and thus the low cross reactivity of commercially available antibodies. To aid in the development of such an assay, Vtg proteins in plasma were identified and characterized from 10 adult female alligators collected during the peak follicular period (from Lake Griffin, FL and Rockefeller State Wildlife Refuge, LA). Two sites were chosen in an effort to reduce site-specific bias. In addition, these sites were chosen for the ecological significance and environmental concerns associated with alligators in these geographical locations. Our study was designed to develop a qualitative method for identifying follicular females and for assessing their reproductive status; and to identify and characterize specific plasma proteins likely to be Vtg. Sodium dodecal sulfate-polyacrylimide gel electrophoresis (SDS-Page) analysis of plasma revealed three prominent protein bands unique to follicular females at \textasciitilde 250 to 450 kilo-daltons (similar to published molecular weights for Vtg or Vtg metabolites from other oviparous species). Further characterization of these proteins revealed that they were highly glycosylated and contained several phosphoserine amino acids. These proteins were isolated by SDS-Page and then confirmed by protein sequencing to have substantial homology with published Vtg sequences from other species. These data are critical for future development of an alligator specific Vtg assay. Such an assay could be used to further identify a possible mechanism for reproductive failures experienced by alligator populations in contaminant-impacted environments. Anatomical evaluations of reproductive status validated the plasma protein screening protocol. There was a 1:1 correlation for vitellogenic females exhibiting plasma proteins in the 250 to 450 kDa range. This correlation provided significant evidence that this is an acceptable method for discerning Vtg animals from non-Vtg animals. Each animal that had the three highly expressed plasma proteins also had a larger number of follicles in the 21 mm to 25 mm or {$>$} 26 mm size classifications.},

  abstract = {1. Predators impose costs on their prey but may also provide benefits such as protection against other (e.g. nest) predators. The optimal breeding location in relation to the distance from a nesting raptor varies so as to minimize the sum of costs of adult and nest predation. We provide a conceptual model to account for variation in the relative predation risks and derive qualitative predictions for how different prey species should respond to the distance from goshawk Accipiter gentilis nests. 2. We test the model predictions using a comprehensive collection of data from northern Finland and central Norway. First, we carried out a series of experiments with artificial bird nests to test if goshawks may provide protection against nest predation. Second, we conducted standard bird censuses and nest-box experiments to detect how the density or territory occupancy of several prey species varies with distance from the nearest goshawk nest. 3. Nest predation rate increased with distance from goshawk nest indicating that goshawks may provide protection for birds' nests against nest predation. Abundance (or probability of presence) of the main prey species of goshawks peaked at intermediate distances from goshawk nests, reflecting the trade-off. The abundance of small songbird species decreased with distance from goshawk nests. The goshawk poses little risk to small songbirds and they may benefit from goshawk proximity in protection against nest predation. Finally, no pattern with distance in pied flycatcher territory (nest box) occupation rate or the onset of egg-laying was detected. This is expected, as flycatchers neither suffer from marked nest predation risk nor are favoured goshawk prey. 4. Our results suggest that territory location in relation to the nest of a predator is a trade-off situation where adult birds weigh the risk of themselves being predated against the benefits accrued from increased nest survival. Prey species appear able to detect and measure alternative predation risks, and respond adaptively. From the prey perspective, the landscape is a mosaic of habitat patches the quality of which varies according to structural and floristic features, but also to the spatial distribution of predators.},

The direct evidence of evolutionary consequences of the biotic rearrangements is of variable quality, but the results of trajectories are becoming clear as the number of studies increases. There are examples of invasive species altering the evolutionary pathway of native species by competitive exclusion, niche displacement, hybridization, introgression, predation, and ultimately extinction. Invaders themselves evolve in response to their interactions with natives, as well as in response to the new abiotic environment. Flexibility in behavior, and mutualistic interactions, can aid in the success of invaders in their new environment.},

  abstract = {Organisms can control movements of nutrients and matter by physically modifying habitat. We examined how an ecosystem engineer, sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), influences seasonal fluxes of sediments, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in streams of southwestern Alaska. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether salmon act as net importers or net exporters of matter and nutrients from streams and how these roles change as a function of salmon population density. We measured discharge and concentrations of suspended sediments and total N and P every 7-14 days for up to four summers in 10 streams spanning a gradient in salmon densities. We statistically allocated whole-season fluxes to salmon activities, such as excretion and bioturbation, and to export by hydrologic discharge. In addition, we used counts of spawning salmon to estimate nutrient and matter imports by salmon to streams. Large seasonal pulses of suspended sediments, P, and N were associated with salmon spawning activities, often increasing export an order of magnitude higher than during pre-salmon levels. Years and streams with more salmon had significantly higher levels of export of sediments and nutrients. In addition, years with higher precipitation had higher background export of P and N. Salmon exported an average of the equivalent of 189\%, 60\%, and 55\% of total matter, P, and N that salmon imported in their bodies. The relative magnitude of export varied; salmon exported more than their bodies imported in 80\%, 20\%, and 16\% across all streams and years for sediments, P, and N, respectively. A bioassay experiment indicated that the P exported by salmon is directly available for use by primary producers in the downstream lake. These results demonstrate that salmon not only move nutrients upstream on large spatial scales via their migration from the ocean and subsequent death, but also redistribute matter and nutrients on finer spatial scales through their spawning activities.},

  abstract = {Dispersal and gene flow can have both positive and negative effects on population size, but little empirical support from nature exists for the negative effects. We test for such effects in a stream population of threespine stickleback (               Gasterosteus aculeatus               L.) that is subject to high gene flow from a lake and is thus maladapted to stream conditions. In this system, maladaptation increases with distance along the stream, and this increase is associated with decreasing population densities until stickleback are no longer present (2.5{$\mkern1mu$}km from the lake). We conducted field experiments to inform whether this association might reflect a negative role for gene flow in constraining population size and therefore causing a local range limit. We specifically tested predictions deriving from theory: peripheral populations should show partial local adaptation, be under strong selection and not simply be maintained by dispersal. First, a transplant experiment suggested a weak home-site advantage in the peripheral population. Second, a mark\textendash recapture study showed directional selection for a stream-adapted phenotype in 1 of 2 years. Third, another mark\textendash recapture experiment showed that dispersal is limited to the point that positive demographic effects of dispersal are probably minimal. We conclude that, although gene flow does constrain morphological maladaptation in the outlet stream population, the evidence for its contribution to population size and range limits is mixed. We discuss the implications of our work for the study of factors influencing the evolution of species' ranges.},

Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S ribosomal DNA sequences of aphid endosymbionts reveals that they are a monophyletic group with a phylogeny completely concordant with that of their hosts, implying long-term cospeciation. Here we show that rates of base substitution are similar in the 16S ribosomal DNA of different endosymbiont lineages. In addition, we calibrate these rates by assigning age estimates for ancestral aphid hosts to the corresponding endosymbionts. The resulting rate estimates (1-2\% per 50 Ma) are among the most reliable available for prokaryotes. They are very near values previously conjectured by using more tenuous assumptions for dating divergence events in eubacteria. Rates calibrated using dates inferred from fossil aphids imply that Asian and American species of the aphid tribe Melaphidina diverged by the early Eocene; this result confirms an earlier hypothesis based on biogeographic evidence. Based on these rate estimates, the minimum age of this endosymbiotic association and the age of aphids as a whole is estimated at 160-280 Ma.},

  abstract = {Genomics has revealed that inheritance systems of separate spe- cies are often not well segregated: genes and capabilities that evolve in one lineage are often stably acquired by another lineage. Although direct gene transfer between species has occurred at some level in all major groups, it appears to be far more frequent in prokaryotes than in multicellular eukaryotes. An alternative to incorporating novel genes into a recipient genome is acquiring a stable, possibly heritable, symbiotic association and thus enjoying benefits of complementary metabolic capabilities. These kinds of symbioses have arisen frequently in animals; for example, many insect groups have diversified on the basis of symbiotic associa- tions acquired early in their evolutionary histories. The resulting associations are highly complex, often involving specialized cell types and organs, developmental mechanisms that ensure transfer of symbionts between generations, and mechanisms for control- ling symbiont proliferation and location. The genomes of long- term obligate symbionts often undergo irreversible gene loss and deterioration even as hosts evolve dependence on them. In some cases, animal genomes may have acquired genes from symbionts, mirroring the gene uptake from mitochondrial and plastid genomes. Multiple symbionts often coexist in the same host, resulting in coadaptation among several phylogenetically distant genomes.},

Aphid color is determined by carotenoids, the same group of chemicals that make flamingos pink. But unlike flamingos, which have to eat colored food to stay pink, aphids make their own pigment. Carotenoids are vital to animals, not only because of their decorative possibilities but also for their oxidation-protective qualities as visual pigments and immune-system modulators. On sifting through an aphid genome, Moran and Jarvik (p. [624][1]; see the Perspective by [Fukatsu][2] ) discovered that the machinery for producing carotenoids has been acquired by an ancestral aphid in a lateral transfer event from a fungus. Although a spontaneous yellow mutant aphid was found that still possesses the sequence for biosynthesis of the red carotenoid pigment torulene, the sequence was discovered to have a single point mutation that puts a stop to turning red.

  abstract = {Reproductive endocrine patterns were characterized in female ocelots (Leopardus pardalis; n = 3), tigrinas (Leopardus tigrinus; n = 2), and margays (Leopardus wiedii; n = 2) housed in captivity in southern Brazil. Females were maintained as singletons and exposed to natural fluctuations in photoperiod. Cyclic changes in ovarian steroids were monitored by analyzing estrogen and progestogen metabolites in fecal samples collected five times weekly for 14 to 18 months. Based on intervals between fecal estrogen peaks, mean (+/- SEM) duration of the estrous cycle was 18.4 +/- 1.6 days for the ocelots (range, 7-31 days; n = 75 cycles), 16.7 +/- 1.3 days for the tigrinas (range, 11-27 days; n = 23 cycles), and 17.6 +/- 1.5 days for the margays (range, 11-25 days; n = 32 cycles). Fecal progestogen analyses combined with two laparoscopic observations of the ovaries confirmed that ocelots and tigrinas did not ovulate spontaneously. In contrast, non-mating-induced luteal phases of 40.1 +/- 6.3 days in duration (range, 30-60 days) were observed frequently in both margays. There was no evidence of gonadal seasonality in margays in either follicular or luteal activity. In ocelots, cyclic changes in estrogen excretion were observed during each month of the year; however, only one female cycled continuously. In the other two ocelots, periods of acyclicity of several months' duration were observed. It was not possible to conclude whether tigrinas were aseasonal because estrous cyclicity was observed in only one of two individuals. In the female that cycled, a 3-month period of acyclicity was observed in the late fall/early winter. These data demonstrate similarities among three felid species of the genus Leopardus, including evidence they are polyestrous but experience unexplained periods of ovarian inactivity. Only the margays differed by exhibiting occasional spontaneous, non-mating-induced ovulations. Historically, these species have not bred well in captivity. However, it is hoped that understanding the biological similarities and differences among them could lead to improved management strategies that may one day result in increased reproductive success.

  abstract = {Breeding close to top predators is a widespread reproductive strategy. Breeding animals may gain indirect benefits if proximity to top predators results in a reduction of predation due to suppression of mesopredators. We tested if passerine birds gain protection from mesopredators by nesting within territories of a top predator, the Ural owl (Strix uralensis). We placed nest boxes for pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) in Ural owl nest sites and in control sites (currently unoccupied by owls). The nest boxes were designed so that nest predation risk could be altered (experimentally increased) after flycatcher settlement; we considered predation rate as a proxy of mesopredator abundance. Overall, we found higher nest predation rates in treatment than in control sites. Flycatcher laying date did not differ between sites, but smaller clutches were laid in treatment sites compared to controls, suggesting a response to perceived predation risk. Relative nest predation rate varied between years, being higher in owl nest sites in 2 years but similar in another; this variation might be indirectly influenced by vole abundance. Proximity to Ural owl nests might represent a risky habitat for passerines. High predation rates within owl territories could be because small mesopredators that do not directly threaten owl nests are attracted to owl nest sites. This could be explained if some mesopredators use owl territories to gain protection from their own predators, or if top predators and mesopredators independently seek similar habitats.},

  abstract = {Plants engage in multiple, simultaneous interactions with other species; some ( enemies) reduce and others (mutualists) enhance plant performance. Moreover, effects of different species may not be independent of one another; for example, enemies may compete, reducing their negative impact on a plant. The magnitudes of positive and negative effects, as well as the frequency of interactive effects and whether they tend to enhance or depress plant performance, have never been comprehensively assessed across the many published studies on plant - enemy and plant - mutualist interactions. We performed a meta-analysis of experiments in which two enemies, two mutualists, or an enemy and a mutualist were manipulated factorially. Specifically, we performed a factorial meta-analysis using the log response ratio. We found that the magnitude of ( negative) enemy effects was greater than that of ( positive) mutualist effects in isolation, but in the presence of other species, the two effects were of comparable magnitude. Hence studies evaluating single-species effects of mutualists may underestimate the true effects found in natural settings, where multiple interactions are the norm and indirect effects are possible. Enemies did not on average influence the effects on plant performance of other enemies, nor did mutualists influence the effects of mutualists. However, these averages mask significant and large, but positive or negative, interactions in individual studies. In contrast, mutualists ameliorated the negative effects of enemies in a manner that benefited plants; this overall effect was driven by interactions between pathogens and belowground mutualists ( bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi). The high frequency of significant interactive effects suggests a widespread potential for diffuse rather than pairwise coevolutionary interactions between plants and their enemies and mutualists. Pollinators and mycorrhizal fungi enhanced plant performance more than did bacterial mutualists. In the greenhouse ( but not the field), pathogens reduced plant performance more than did herbivores, pathogens were more damaging to herbaceous than to woody plants, and herbivores were more damaging to crop than to non-crop plants ( suggesting evolutionary change in plants or herbivores following crop domestication). We discuss how observed differences in effect size might be confounded with methodological differences among studies.},

Use of existing datasets allows questions to be addressed more quickly, more generally, and at larger scales than would otherwise be possible.

Most ecological datasets do not adhere to any agreed-upon standards in format, data structure or method of access. Some may be broken up across multiple files, stored in compressed archives, and violate basic principles of data structure. As a result acquiring and utilizing available datasets can be a time consuming and error prone process. The EcoData Retriever is an extensible software framework which automates the tasks of discovering, downloading, and reformatting ecological data files for storage in a local data file or relational database. The automation of these tasks saves significant time for researchers and substantially reduces the likelihood of errors resulting from manual data manipulation and unfamiliarity with the complexities of individual datasets.},

Here, we report that evolution of life-history traits not directly related to competition, such as longevity, and predator avoidance, easily collapses competitive coexistence in several competition systems: spatially structured, and predator-mediated two-species competition systems. In addition, we found that a superior competitor can be excluded by an inferior one by common mechanisms among the models. Our results suggest that ecological competitive coexistence due to a lifehistory trait trade-off balance may not be balanced on an evolutionary timescale, that is, it may be evolutionarily fragile.},

To address this, we developed an extension of a multi-locus, multi-trait ecoevolutionary individual-based model that incorporates several interacting species in explicit landscapes. We simulated eco-evolutionary dynamics of multiple species food webs with different degrees of connectance across soil-moisture islands. A broad set of parameter combinations led to the local extinction of species, but some species persisted, and this was associated with (1) high connectance and omnivory and (2) ongoing evolution, due to multi-trait genetic variability of the embedded species. Furthermore, persistence was highest at intermediate island distances, likely because of a balance between predation-induced extinction (strongest at short island distances) and the coupling of island diversity by top predators, which by travelling among islands exert global top-down control of biodiversity. In the simulations with high genetic variation, we also found widespread trait evolutionary changes indicative of eco-evolutionary dynamics. We discuss how the ever-increasing computing power and high-resolution data availability will soon allow researchers to start bridging the in vivo\textendash in silico gap.},

  abstract = {The role of behavior in evolution has long been discussed, with some arguing that behavior promotes evolution by exposing organisms to selection (behavioral drive) and others proposing that it inhibits evolution by shielding organisms from environmental variation (behavioral inertia). However, this discussion has generally focused on the effects of behavior along a single axis without considering that behavior simultaneously influences selection in various niche dimensions. By examining evolutionary change along two distinct niche axes\textemdash structural and thermal\textemdash we propose that behavior simultaneously drives and impedes evolution in a group of Anolis lizards from the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. Specifically, a behavioral shift in microhabitat to boulders at high altitude enables thermoregulation, thus forestalling physiological evolution in spite of colder environments. This same behavioral shift drives skull and limb evolution to boulder use. Our results emphasize the multidimensional effects of behavior in evolution. These findings reveal how, rather than being diametrically opposed, niche conservatism and niche lability can occur simultaneously. Furthermore, patterns of niche evolution may vary at different geographic scales: because of thermoregulatory behavior, lizards at high and low elevation share similar microclimatic niches (consistent with niche conservatism) while inhabiting distinct macroclimatic environments (consistent with niche divergence). Together, our results suggest that behavior can connect patterns of niche divergence and conservatism at different geographic scales and among traits.},

Destined to become an instant classic, R Graphics presents the first complete, authoritative exposition on the R graphical system. Paul Murrell, widely known as the leading expert on R graphics, has developed an in-depth resource that takes nothing for granted and helps both neophyte and seasoned users master the intricacies of R graphics. After an introductory overview of R graphics facilities, the presentation first focuses on the traditional graphics system, showing how to work the traditional functions, describing functions that are available to produce complete plots, and how to customize the details of plots. The second part of the book describes the grid graphics system - a system unique to R and much more powerful than the traditional system. The author, who was integral in the development of the grid system, shows, starting from a blank page, how it can be used to produce graphical scenes. He also describes how to develop new graphical functions that are easy for others to use and build on. Appendices contain a brief introduction to the R system in general and discuss how the traditional and grid graphics systems can be combined. Much of the information presented in this book cannot be found anywhere else. Well ahead of the curve, particularly regarding the grid system, R Graphics will have a major impact on the future direction of statistical graphics development.

This mismatch is an unsolved evolutionary paradox. Here we show that lower quality, or more dilute, nectars evolve when the strength of preferring larger quantities or higher qualities of nectar diminishes as magnitudes of the physical stimuli increase. In a virtual evolution experiment conducted in the tropical rainforest, bats visited computer-automated flowers with simulated genomes that evolved relatively dilute nectars. Simulations replicated this evolution only when value functions, which relate the physical stimuli to subjective sensations, were nonlinear. Selection also depended on the supply/demand ratio; bats selected for more dilute nectar when competition for food was higher. We predict such a pattern to generally occur when decision-makers consider multiple value dimensions simultaneously, and increases of psychological value are not fully proportional to increases in physical magnitude.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {We urgently need to predict species responses to climate change to minimize future biodiversity loss and ensure we do not waste limited resources on ineffective conservation strategies. Currently, most predictions of species responses to climate change ignore the potential for evolution. However, evolution can alter species ecological responses, and different aspects of evolution and ecology can interact to produce complex eco-evolutionary dynamics under climate change. Here we review how evolution could alter ecological responses to climate change on species warm and cool range margins, where evolution could be especially important. We discuss different aspects of evolution in isolation, and then synthesize results to consider how multiple evolutionary processes might interact and affect conservation strategies. On species cool range margins, the evolution of dispersal could increase range expansion rates and allow species to adapt to novel conditions in their new range. However, low genetic variation and genetic drift in small range-front populations could also slow or halt range expansions. Together, these eco-evolutionary effects could cause a three-step, stop-and-go expansion pattern for many species. On warm range margins, isolation among populations could maintain high genetic variation that facilitates evolution to novel climates and allows species to persist longer than expected without evolution. This 'evolutionary extinction debt' could then prevent other species from shifting their ranges. However, as climate change increases isolation among populations, increasing dispersal mortality could select for decreased dispersal and cause rapid range contractions. Some of these eco-evolutionary dynamics could explain why many species are not responding to climate change as predicted. We conclude by suggesting that resurveying historical studies that measured trait frequencies, the strength of selection, or heritabilities could be an efficient way to increase our eco-evolutionary knowledge in climate change biology.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Do young reptiles avoid paying the metabolic costs of rapid growth? Growing mam- mals and birds must spend extra energy, beyond the metabolic costs they have when not growing, to pay the cost of synthesizing new tissues. This synthesis cost is in addition to the other costs that growing animals pay to forage for, consume, digest and allocate the extra food they need to produce new body substance. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that free-living neonate and juvenile terrestrial vertebrates in general will have basal (standard) and field metabolic rates and feeding rates that are higher than expected for (non-growing) adults of the same body mass. Suckling mammals and neonate precocial birds do have relatively high basal metabolic rates. Among reptiles however, currently available data on standard metabolic rates (SMR) of neonates indicates no sig- nificant increment over adult SMR. In the field, metabolic increments due to the additional growth- associated costs should be relatively large and hence readily detectable in neonate reptiles. To date, the field metabolic rates (FMR's) of neonates and juveniles have been measured in ten species of reptiles: three phrynosomatid lizards, three lacertid lizards, two iguanid lizards, one agamid lizard, and one chelonian. The neonate lizards all had metabolic rates that were similar to those measured simultaneously in free-living adults, after correction for body mass differences (using mass0-80). The chelonian (Gopherus agassizii) juveniles also showed no obvious increment in energy expenditure over adults. More careful measurements of SMR in neonate reptiles should be done to determine if reptiles are free of the large energetic "tax"on growth that is paid by neonate mammals and precocial birds. Studies of neonate altricial birds, which are ectothermic for some time after hatching and have low SMR's, also may be instructive in this regard. Field studies of neonate reptile time- activity budgets are needed to determine how they achieve such low field metabolic rates while simultaneously growing rapidly. Do neonates have lower body temperatures on average during their activity period? Do neonates spend less time active each day than adults? Do neonates use micro- habitat resources in ways that reduce intraspecific competition with adults, but allow for rapid growth anyway? Are the thermal dependencies of digestion, metabolism and growth different in neonates, thereby allowing them to function well and grow rapidly at lower daily integrated body temperatures?},

  abstract = {The field metabolic rates (FMRs) of 229 species of terrestrial vertebrates, all measured using the doubly labeled water method in free-living individuals, were evaluated. Daily rates of energy expenditure were as low as 0.23 kJ per day in a small reptile (gecko), to as high as 52 500 kJ per day in a marine mammal (seal). This is a range of nearly six orders of magnitude. More than 70\% of the variation in log-transformed data is due to variation in body size (expressed as body mass). Much of the remaining variation is accounted for by thermal physiology, with the endothermic mammals and birds having FMRs that are about 12 and 20 times higher, respectively, than FMRs of equivalent-sized, but ectothermic, reptiles. Variation in log(body mass) within each of these three taxonomic classes accounts for over 94\% of the variation in log(FMR), and results from nonlinear regression analyses using untransformed data support this conclusion. However, the range of residual variation in mass-adjusted FMR within classes is still more than sixfold (ratio of highest over lowest). Some of this variation is associated with affiliations with lower taxonomic levels (Infraclass: eutherian vs metatherian mammals; Family: passerine, procellariform and galliform birds vs other birds), some is associated with habitat (especially desert vs nondesert), and some with differences in basic diet preference and foraging mode and season. The scaling slopes for FMR often differ from BMR slopes for the same Class of animals, and most differ from the theoretical slope of 0.75. Differences among slopes and intercepts that were detected using conventional regression analyses were largely confirmed upon reanalysis using Independent Contrasts Analysis to adjust for phylogenetic biases.},

For the many breeding birds facing high nest-predation pressure, enemy-free space can be gained by nesting near more formidable animals for physical protection. While the benefits to protected species seem well documented, very few studies have explored whether and how protector species are affected by nest protection associations. Long-legged wading birds (Pelecaniformes and Ciconiiformes) actively choose nesting sites above resident American alligators ( Alligator mississippiensis ), apparently to take advantage of the protection from mammalian nest predators that alligator presence offers. Previous research has shown that wading bird nesting colonies could provide substantial food for alligators in the form of dropped chicks. We compared alligator body condition in similar habitat with and without wading bird nesting colonies present. Alligator morphometric body condition indices were significantly higher in colony than in non-colony locations, an effect that was statistically independent of a range of environmental variables. Since colonially nesting birds and crocodilians co-occur in many tropical and subtropical wetlands, our results highlight a potentially widespread keystone process between two ecologically important species-groups. These findings suggest the interaction is highly beneficial for both groups of actors, and illustrate how selective pressures may have acted to form and reinforce a strongly positive ecological interaction.},

However, next-generation sequencing applications and high-throughput SNP genotyping assays exposed the limitation of DNA quantity one usually gets from a single individual mosquito. Whole genome amplification could alleviate the issue but it also creates bias in genome representation. While trying to find alternative DNA extraction protocols for improved DNA yield, we found that a combination of the tissue lysis protocol from Life Technologies and the DNA extraction protocol from Qiagen yielded a higher DNA amount than the protocol using the Qiagen or Life Technologies kit only. We have not rigorously tested all the possible combinations of extraction protocols; we also only tested this on mosquito samples. Therefore, our finding should be noted as a suggestion for improving people's own DNA extraction protocols and not as an advertisement of a commercially available product.},

  abstract = {Large-bodied apex predators (e.g., sharks, wolves, crocodilians) are believed to regulate food web structure and drive ecosystem processes, but there remains relatively little experimental evidence. Here we use field surveys and a mesocosm experiment to evaluate the cascading effects of an apex predator (American alligator) on a salt marsh food web. Consistent with previous studies (n = 10), field surveys revealed blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus Rathbun 1896), an important marsh mesopredator, were a frequent component of estuarine-occurring alligators' diet (mean{$\pm$}SD, 47{$\pm$}20\%, n=1384). In mesocosms, we examined potential consequences of this interaction in a simplified salt marsh community. We experimentally isolated alligator effects on the abundance (consumptive effect) and behavior (non-consumptive effect) of blue crabs and on blue crab consumption of plant-grazing snails and ribbed mussels. Alligators reduced blue crab abundance by \textasciitilde 40\% over 3 days and in- duced behavioral changes, resulting in decreased foraging activity and increased refuge use by blue crabs. The combined effects of reduced crab abundance and altered behavior translated into increased survival of both a keystone grazer (snails) and a mutualist (mussels) within the salt marsh food web. Our findings experimentally demonstrate that a large-bodied, apex predator has the potential to 1) generate a trophic cascade, 2) elicit behav- ioral changes (i.e., non-consumptive effects) in mesopredator prey, and 3) indirectly affect the potential for both grazing and mutualism to occur in this food chain. Our results generate testable hypotheses regarding the broad-scale effects of alligator presence and top-down forcing in salt marsh ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) is a widespread aquatic predator throughout the southeastern United States. Historically, the ecological interactions of A. mississippiensis have been studied in the context of freshwater ecosystems such as inland lakes. Lacking salt secreting glands maintained in closely related crocodiles (Crocodylidae), the occurrence of A. mississippiensis in higher salinity marine and estuarine ecosystems has often been considered aberrant and of no particular importance to ecological processes in these coastal systems. However, it is well known that top-predators have the potential to exhibit strong effects within food webs through their interactions with prey and movement between disparate ecosystems. Within this dissertation, I set out to demonstrate that the use of marine and estuarine ecosystems by A. mississippiensis is common and that these behaviors have the potential to affect isolated freshwater ponds and wetlands by transferring marine- derived nutrients and salt marshes through their interactions with an important mesopredator (Callinectes sapidus, Blue crab). First, I employed field studies using nightlight surveys, stomach content analysis, and stable isotope analysis to assess intra-population variation in the use of marine habitat and food resources by A. mississippiensis inhabiting an Atlantic barrier island. Second, I used GPS/VHF telemetry to assess the effect of abiotic factors on cross- ecosystem movement patterns of adult individuals. Third, I attached and deployed animal-borne imaging systems (Crittercam) to quantify prey attack and capture success rates as well as diel activity patterns and investigated variation in these parameters. Lastly, I experimentally tested the potential of A. mississippiensis to elicit a trophic cascade within a simplified salt marsh food web through consumptive and non- consumptive interactions with the mesopredator C. sapidus. Results from this body of work will advance our understanding of the role A. mississippiensis serves in coastal ecosystems and provide essential data to predict consequences of changing environment conditions.},

  abstract = {Abstract: The formation of collaborating pairs by indi\- viduals belonging to two different classes occurs in the contexts of reproduction and intra-specific cooperation as well as of inter-specific mutualism. There is potential for partner choice and for competition for access to pre\- ferred partners in all three contexts. These selective forces have long been recognised as important in sexual selection, but their impact is not yet appreciated in co\- operative and mutualistic systems. The formation of partnerships between members of different classes has much in common with the conclusion of trade agree\- ments in human markets with two classes of traders, like producers and consumers, or employers and employees. Similar game-theoretical models can be used to predict the behaviour of rational traders in human markets and the evolutionarily stable strategies used in biological markets. We present a formal model in which the influ\- ence of the market mechanism on selection is made ex\- plicit. We restrict ourselves to biological markets in which: (1) Individuals do not compete over access to partners in an agonistic manner, but rather by outcom\- peting each other in those aspects that are preferred by the choosing party. (2) The commodity the partner has to offer cannot be obtained by the use of force, but re\- quires the consent of the partner. These two restrictions ensure a dominant role for partner choice in the forma\- tion of partnerships. In a biological market model the decision to cooperate is based on the comparison be\- tween the offers of several potential partners, rather than on the behaviour of a single potential partner, as is implicitly assumed in currently accepted models of co\- operation. In our example the members of one class A offer a commodity of fixed value in exchange for a com\- modity of variable value supplied by the other class, B. We show that when the B-class outnumbers the A-class sufficiently and the cost for the A-class to sample the offers of the B-class are low, the choosiness of the A-class will lead to selection for the supply of high value commodities by the B-class (Fig. 3a). Under the same market conditions, but with a high sampling cost this may still be the evolutionarily stable outcome, but an\- other pair of strategies proves to be stable too: relaxed choosiness of class A coupled with low value commodi\- ties supplied by class B (Fig. 3b). We give a number of examples of mating, cooperative and mutualistic mar\- kets that resemble the low sampling cost situation de\- picted in Fig. 3a.},

  abstract = {Although it is well understood that selection shapes the polymorphism pattern in Drosophila, signatures of classic selective sweeps are scarce. Here, we focus on Drosophila mauritiana, an island endemic, which is closely related to Drosophila melanogaster. Based on a new, annotated genome sequence, we characterized the genome-wide polymorphism by sequencing pooled individuals (Pool-seq). We show that the interplay between selection and recombination results in a genome-wide polymorphism pattern characteristic for D. mauritiana. Two large genomic regions ({$>$}500 kb) showed the signature of almost complete selective sweeps. We propose that the absence of population structure and limited geographic distribution could explain why such pronounced sweep patterns are restricted to D. mauritiana. Further evidence for strong adaptive evolution was detected for several nucleoporin genes, some of which were not previously identified as genes involved in genomic conflict. Since this adaptive evolution is continuing after the split of D. mauritiana and Drosophila simulans, we conclude that genomic conflict is not restricted to short episodes, but rather an ongoing process in Drosophila.},

Forecasting these changes and designing adequate management of future ecosystem services will require predictive models encompassing the most fundamental biotic responses. However, most present models omit important processes such as evolution and competition(4,5). Here we develop a spatially explicit eco-evolutionary model of multi-species responses to climate change. We demonstrate that both dispersal and evolution differentially mediate extinction risks and biodiversity alterations through time and across climate gradients. Together, high genetic variance and low dispersal best minimized extinction risks. Surprisingly, high dispersal did not reduce extinctions, because the shifting ranges of some species hastened the decline of others. Evolutionary responses dominated during the later stages of climatic changes and in hot regions. No extinctions occurred without competition, which highlights the importance of including species interactions in global biodiversity models. Most notably, climate change created extinction and evolutionary debts, with changes in species richness and traits occuring long after climate stabilization. Therefore, even if we halt anthropogenic climate change today, transient eco-evolutionary dynamics would ensure centuries of additional alterations in global biodiversity.},

We searched for nests of curlews from an area of 6 km2 during 1985-1993. For each nest found, we recorded the fate of the nest, and the distance to the nearest kestrel nest and to the nearest perch. We measured the impact of breeding kestrels on nest predation by constructing artifi- cial curlew nests in the vicinity of ten kestrel nests in 1993. Curlew nests were closer to kestrel nests than ex- pected from random distribution, eventhough kestrels fed on average 5.5\% of curlew chick production. Predation risk by kestrels was lower than predation risk by corvids and other generalist predators, which predated 9\% of curlew nests surviving farming practices and an un- known proportion of chicks. Artificial nest experiment showed that nest predation was lower close to kestrel nests than further away suggesting that the breeding as- sociation of curlews and kestrels was a behavioural adap- tation against nest predation. Thus, the presence of a pre- dator may sometimes be beneficial to prey, and prey ani- mals have behavioural adaptations to these situations.},

We predicted that, if this density depression is due to predation, the observed density pattern should develop gradually during the breeding season as raptors deplete the prey populations. In contrast, if the low abundance is a result of predator avoidance during breeding habitat selection, the observed pattern should be evident from the beginning of the breeding season. We tested these predictions by counting breeding birds along transect lines (length 700 m, width 100 m) radiating away from Kestrel Falco tinnunculus nests, and along control transect lines situated {$>$}1000 m from Kestrel nests, five times in the course of the 1994 breeding season in western Finland. Breeding bird density was ca. 25\% lower within 700 m of the Kestrel nests than on control sites. The positive relationship between bird densities and the distance from Kestrel nests was most evident in the early breeding season, which supports the predator avoidance hypothesis. The effect of predator presence on the distribution of breeding pairs seemed to be weak at species level but stronger at community level. At the beginning of the breeding season, distance from predator nests explained a larger proportion of the observed variation in the number of birds or species than any of the habitat variables used.},

In contrast, modelling arms races involving multiple traits, we found that arms races can promote diversification when trade-off costs among traits make simultaneous investment in multiple traits either more beneficial or more costly. Coevolution between resource and consumer species generates an adaptive landscape for each, with the configuration giving predictable suites of consumer and resource species. Nonetheless, the adaptive landscape contains multiple alternative stable states, and which stable community is reached depends on small stochastic differences occurring along evolutionary pathways. Our results may solve a puzzling conflict between eco-evolutionary theory that predicts community diversification via consumer\textendash resource interactions will be rare, and empirical research that has uncovered real cases. Furthermore, our results suggest that these real cases might be just a subset of alternative stable communities.},

We review here recent evidence indicating that variability in the completeness of speciation can also be associated with the nature of divergent selection itself, with speciation being greatly promoted by (i) stronger selection on a given, single trait (the 'stronger selection' hypothesis) and (ii) selection on a greater number of traits (the 'multifarious selection' hypothesis).

To determine the potential to predict evolutionary change, Nosil               et al.               examined three naturally occurring morphs of stick insects (see the Perspective by Reznick and Travis). They wanted to determine which selective parameters could be used to foresee changes, despite varying environmental conditions. One morph fit a model of negative frequency-dependent selection, likely owing to predation, but changes in other morph frequencies remained unpredictable. Thus, for specific cases, we can forecast short-term changes within populations, but evolution is more difficult to predict when it involves a balance between multiple selective factors and uncertainty in environmental conditions.

We studied the evolution of cryptic body coloration and pattern in a stick insect using 25 years of field data, experiments, and genomics. We found that evolution is more difficult to predict when it involves a balance between multiple selective factors and uncertainty in environmental conditions than when it involves feedback loops that cause consistent back-and-forth fluctuations. Specifically, changes in color-morph frequencies are modestly predictable through time (               r               2               = 0.14) and driven by complex selective regimes and yearly fluctuations in climate. In contrast, temporal changes in pattern-morph frequencies are highly predictable due to negative frequency-dependent selection (               r               2               = 0.86). For both traits, however, natural selection drives evolution around a dynamic equilibrium, providing some predictability to the process.},

  abstract = {Periodical cicadas emerge from below ground every 13 or 17 years in North American forests, with individual broods representing the synchronous movement of trillions of individuals across geographic regions. Due to predator satiation, most individuals escape predation, die, and become deposited as detritus. Some of this emergent biomass falls into woodland aquatic habitats (small streams and woodland ponds) and serves as a high-quality allochthonous detritus pulse in early summer. We present results of a two-part study in which we (1) quantified deposition of Brood X periodical cicada detritus into woodland ponds and low-order streams in southwestern Ohio, and (2) conducted an outdoor mesocosm experiment in which we examined the effects of deposition of different amounts of cicada detritus on food webs characteristic of forest ponds. In the mesocosm experiment, we manipulated the amount of cicada detritus input to examine if food web dynamics and stability varied with the magnitude of this allochthonous resource subsidy, as predicted by numerous theoretical models. Deposition data indicate that, during years of periodical cicada emergence, cicada carcasses can represent a sizable pulse of allochthonous detritus to forest aquatic ecosystems. In the mesocosm experiment, cicada carcass deposition rapidly affected food webs, leading to substantial increases in nutrients and organism biomass, with the magnitude of increase dependent upon the amount of cicada detritus. Deposition of cicada detritus impacted the stability of organism functional groups and populations by affecting the temporal variability and biomass minima. However, contrary to theory, stability measures were not consistently related to the size of the allochthonous pulse (i.e., the amount of cicada detritus). Our study underscores the need for theory to further explore consequences of pulsed allochthonous subsidies for food web stability. \textcopyright{} 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.},

As control solutions, we used pure distilled water and distilled water with the osmotic potential adjusted with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to match that of root and shoot extracts of B. nigra. RESULTS: The extracts had a strong negative effect on germination rates and seedling root lengths of target species compared to the water-control. Compared to the osmolalityadjusted controls, the extracts had a negative effect on seedling root length. We found no differences between the effects of B. nigra plant extracts from the invasive vs. native populations on germination rates and seedling root growth of target plant species. Responses were largely independent of whether the target plant species were from the invaded or native range of B. nigra. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that B. nigra can interfere with other species through allelochemical interactions, but do not support predictions of the novel-weapons hypothesis and evolution of increased allelopathy.},

The model gives reasonable estimates of the effects of enrichment on benthic detritus, aquatic macrophytes and phytoplankton, and conservative estimates of the increase of zooplankton and fish stocks. Simulated levels of the above components decreased toward nominal states after simulated abandonment by birds, and the rates of decrease generally followed field trends that were measured. The model indicates that nesting wading birds can have considerable effects on aspects of an aquatic ecosystem that are not normally associated with them (such as benthic detritus and fish). Significant links between components of aerial and aquatic systems are thus brought to light.},

  abstract = {Natural enemies are important ecological and evolutionary forces, and heritable variation in resistance to enemies is a prerequisite for adaptive responses of populations. Such variation in resistance has been previously documented for pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) attacked by the parasitoid wasp Aphidius ervi. Although the variation was presumed to reflect genotypic differences among the aphids, another potential source of resistance to A. ervi is infection by the facultative bacterial symbiont Hamiltonella defensa. Here, we explored whether variation among symbiont isolates underlies variation among A. pisum clones in resistance to A. ervi. Although maternally transmitted, H. defensa is sometimes horizontally transferred in nature and can be experimentally established in clonal aphid lineages. We established five H. defensa isolates in a common A. pisum genetic background. All of the five isolates tested, including one originating from another aphid species, conferred resistance. Furthermore, isolates varied in levels of resistance conferred, ranging from 19\% to nearly 100\% resistance. In contrast, a single H. defensa isolate established in five different aphid clones conferred similar levels of resistance; that is, host genotype did not influence resistance level. These results indicate that symbiont-mediated resistance to parasitism is a general phenomenon in A. pisum and that, at least for the isolates and genotypes considered, it is the symbiont isolate that determines the level of resistance, not aphid genotype or any interaction between isolate and genotype. Thus, acquisition of a heritable symbiont appears to be a major mode of adaptation to natural enemy pressure in these insects.},

  abstract = {Symbiotic associations between animals and inherited micro-organisms are widespread in nature. In many cases, hosts may be superinfected with multiple inherited symbionts. Acyrthosiphon pisum (the pea aphid) may harbour more than one facultative symbiont (called secondary symbionts) in addition to the obligate primary symbiont, Buchnera aphidicola . Previously we demonstrated that, in a controlled genetic background, A. pisum infected with either Serratia symbiotica or Hamiltonella defensa (called R- and T-type in that study) were more resistant to attack by the parasitoid Aphidius ervi . Here, we examined the consequences of A. pisum superinfected with both resistance-conferring symbionts. We found that an A. pisum line co-infected with both S. symbiotica and H. defensa symbionts exhibits even greater resistance to parasitism by A. ervi than either of the singly infected lines. Despite this added benefit to resistance, superinfections of S. symbiotica and H. defensa symbionts appeared rare in our survey of Utah A. pisum symbionts, which is probably attributable to severe fecundity costs. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction estimates indicate that while the density of H. defensa is similar in singly and superinfected hosts, S. symbiotica densities increased dramatically in superinfected hosts. Over-proliferation of symbionts or antagonistic interactions between symbionts may be harmful to the aphid host. Our results indicate that in addition to host\textendash symbiont interactions, interactions among the symbionts themselves probably play a critical role in determining the distributions of symbionts in natural populations.},

In a controlled genetic background, we show that a toxin-encoding bacteriophage is required to produce the protective phenotype. Phage loss occurs repeatedly in laboratory-held H. defensa-infected aphid clonal lines, resulting in increased susceptibility to parasitism in each instance. Our results show that these mobile genetic elements can endow a bacterial symbiont with benefits that extend to the animal host.

  abstract = {Recent findings indicate that several insect lineages receive protection against particular natural enemies through infection with heritable symbionts, but little is yet known about whether enemies are able to discriminate and respond to symbiont-based defense. The pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, receives protection against the parasitic wasp, Aphidius ervi, when infected with the bacterial symbiont Hamiltonella defensa and its associated bacteriophage APSE (Acyrthosiphon pisum secondary endosymbiont). Internally developing parasitoid wasps, such as A. ervi, use maternal and embryonic factors to create an environment suitable for developing wasps. If more than one parasitoid egg is deposited into a single aphid host (superparasitism), then additional complements of these factors may contribute to the successful development of the single parasitoid that emerges. We performed experiments to determine if superparasitism is a tactic allowing wasps to overcome symbiont-mediated defense. We found that the deposition of two eggs into symbiont-protected aphids significantly increased rates of successful parasitism relative to singly parasitized aphids. We then conducted behavioral assays to determine whether A. ervi selectively superparasitizes H. defensa-infected aphids. In choice tests, we found that A. ervi tends to deposit a single egg in uninfected aphids, but two or more eggs in H. defensa-infected aphids, indicating that oviposition choices may be largely determined by infection status. Finally, we identified differences in the quantity of the trans-{$\beta$}-farnesene, the major component of aphid alarm pheromone, between H. defensa-infected and uninfected aphids, which may form the basis for discrimination. Here we show that the parasitic wasp A. ervi discriminates among symbiont-infected and uninfected aphids, and changes its oviposition behavior in a way that increases the likelihood of overcoming symbiont-based defense. More generally, our results indicate that natural enemies are not passive victims of defensive symbionts, and that an evolutionary arms race between A. pisum and the parasitoid A. ervi may be mediated by a bacterial symbiosis.},

  abstract = {Populations facing novel environments can persist by adapting. In nature, the ability to adapt and persist will depend on interactions between coexisting individuals. Here we use an adaptive dynamic model to assess how the potential for evolutionary rescue is affected by intra- and interspecific competition. Intraspecific competition (negative density-dependence) lowers abundance, which decreases the supply rate of beneficial mutations, hindering evolutionary rescue. On the other hand, interspecific competition can aid evolutionary rescue when it speeds adaptation by increasing the strength of selection. Our results clarify this point and give an additional requirement: competition must increase selection pressure enough to overcome the negative effect of reduced abundance. We therefore expect evolutionary rescue to be most likely in communities which facilitate rapid niche displacement. Our model, which aligns to previous quantitative and population genetic models in the absence of competition, provides a first analysis of when competitors should help or hinder evolutionary rescue. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

  abstract = {Predators are widely assumed to create selection that shapes the evolution of prey escape abilities. However, this assumption is difficult to test directly due to the challenge of recording both predation and its evolutionary con sequences in the wild. We examined these events by studying natural and experimental populations of Trinidadian guppies, Poecilia reticulate, which occur in distinct high-predation and low-predation environments within streams. Importantly, in the last two decades several populations of guppies have been experimentally introduced from one type of predatory environment into the other, allowing measurements of the consequences of change. We used this system to test two hypotheses: First, that changes in predatory environments create phenotypic selection favoring changes in escape ability of guppies, and second, that this selection can result in rapid evolution. For the first test we compared escape ability of wild caught guppies from high- versus low-predation environments by measuring survival rates during staged encounters with a major predator, the pike cichlid Crenicichla alta. We used guppies from three streams, comparing two within-stream pairs of natural populations and three within-stream pairs of an introduced population versus its natural source population. In every comparison, guppies from the high-predation population showed higher survival. These multiple, parallel divergences in guppy survival phenotype suggest that predatory environment does create selection of escape ability. We tested our second hypothesis by rearing guppies in common garden conditions in the laboratory, then repeating the earlier experiments using the: F generation. As before, each comparison resulted in higher survival of guppies descended from the high-predation populations, demonstrating that population differences in escape ability have a genetic basis. These results also show that escape ability can evolve very rapidly in nature, that is, within 26-36 generations in the introduced populations. Interestingly, we found rapid evolutionary loss of escape ability in populations introduced into low-predation environments, suggesting that steep fitness trade-offs may influence the evolution of escape traits.},

  abstract = {Background: Sequencing technology and assembly algorithms have matured to the point that high-quality de novo assembly is possible for large, repetitive genomes. Current assemblies traverse transposable elements (TEs) and provide an opportunity for comprehensive annotation of TEs. Numerous methods exist for annotation of each class of TEs, but their relative performances have not been systematically compared. Moreover, a comprehensive pipeline is needed to produce a non-redundant library of TEs for species lacking this resource to generate whole-genome TE annotations. Results: We benchmark existing programs based on a carefully curated library of rice TEs. We evaluate the performance of methods annotating long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, terminal inverted repeat (TIR) transposons, short TIR transposons known as miniature inverted transposable elements (MITEs), and Helitrons. Performance metrics include sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, FDR, and F1. Using the most robust programs, we create a comprehensive pipeline called Extensive de-novo TE Annotator (EDTA) that produces a filtered non-redundant TE library for annotation of structurally intact and fragmented elements. EDTA also deconvolutes nested TE insertions frequently found in highly repetitive genomic regions. Using other model species with curated TE libraries (maize and Drosophila), EDTA is shown to be robust across both plant and animal species. Conclusions: The benchmarking results and pipeline developed here will greatly facilitate TE annotation in eukaryotic genomes. These annotations will promote a much more in-depth understanding of the diversity and evolution of TEs at both intra- and inter-species levels. EDTA is open-source and freely available: https://github.com/oushujun/EDTA.},

To better understand how global hypoxia and hyperoxia might have affected the growth and physiology of contemporary vertebrates, we incubated eggs and raised hatchlings of the American alligator. Crocodilians are one of few vertebrate taxa that survived these global changes with distinctly conservative morphology. We maintained animals at 30 degrees C under chronic hypoxia (12\% O(2)), normoxia (21\% O(2)) or hyperoxia (30\% O(2)). At hatching, hypoxic animals were significantly smaller than their normoxic and hyperoxic siblings. Over the course of 3 months, post-hatching growth was fastest under hyperoxia and slowest under hypoxia. Hypoxia, but not hyperoxia, caused distinct scaling of major visceral organs-reduction of liver mass, enlargement of the heart and accelerated growth of lungs. When absorptive and post-absorptive metabolic rates were measured in juvenile alligators, the increase in oxygen consumption rate due to digestion/absorption of food was greatest in hyperoxic alligators and smallest in hypoxic ones. Hyperoxic alligators exhibited the lowest breathing rate and highest oxygen consumption per breath. We suggest that, despite compensatory cardiopulmonary remodelling, growth of hypoxic alligators is constrained by low atmospheric oxygen supply, which may limit their food utilisation capacity. Conversely, the combination of elevated metabolism and low cost of breathing in hyperoxic alligators allows for a greater proportion of metabolised energy to be available for growth. This suggests that growth and metabolic patterns of extinct vertebrates would have been significantly affected by changes in the atmospheric oxygen level.},

Environmental heterogeneity that affects the outcome of competition is present in all of these models and may be spatial, temporal, biotic in origin, abiotic in origin, or any mixture of these. The principal result is that the models predict coexistence if the plant species are sufficiently dissimilar-if they sufficiently partition the spatial, temporal, biotic, or abiotic envi- ronmental heterogeneity. Second, we study a complex forest-simulation model of competition among individuals for light and a nutrient. Whereas the nonspatial version of this model predicts that a single species will outcompete all others, the spatial version predicts that coexistence is possible. We show that the results for the analytically tractable models appear to explain the cause and pattern of coexistence in the simulation model.},

We assume that individuals experience two discrete environments probabilistically in time (as a Markov process) and that there are two different phenotypic states, each yielding the highest fitness in one of the two environments. We compare the expected fitness of a phenotypically fixed individual to that of an individual whose phenotype is induced to produce the better phenotype in each environment with a time lag between experiencing a new environment and realization of the new phenotype. Such time lags are common in organisms where phenotypically plastic, inducible traits have been documented. We find that although plasticity is generally adaptive when time lags are short (relative to the time scale of environmental variability), plasticity can be disadvantageous for longer lag times. Asymmetries in environmental change probabilities and/or the relative fitnesses of each phenotype strongly influence whether plasticity is favoured. In contrast to other models, our model does not require costs for plasticity to be disadvantageous; costs affect the results quantitatively, not qualitatively. \textcopyright{} 1996 Chapman \& Hall.},

In addition, almost nothing is known about the role of coevolution in shaping ecosystem function. Here, we experimentally evaluated the relative effects of species invasion (a traditional ecological effect), evolution and coevolution on ecosystem processes in Trinidadian streams. We manipulated the presence and population-of-origin of two common fish species, the guppy (Poecilia reticulata) and the killifish (Rivulus hartii). We measured epilithic algal biomass and accrual, aquatic invertebrate biomass, and detrital decomposition. Our results show that, for some ecosystem responses, the effects of evolution and coevolution were larger than the effects of species invasion. Guppy evolution in response to alternative predation regimes significantly influenced algal biomass and accrual rates. Guppies from a high-predation site caused an increase in algae relative to guppies from a low-predation site; algae effects were probably shaped by observed divergence in rates of nutrient excretion and algae consumption. Rivulus-guppy coevolution significantly influenced the biomass of aquatic invertebrates. Locally coevolved populations reduced invertebrate biomass relative to non-coevolved populations. These results challenge the general assumption that intraspecific diversity is a less critical determinant of ecosystem function than is interspecific diversity. Given existing evidence for contemporary evolution in these fish species, our findings suggest considerable potential for eco-evolutionary feedbacks to operate as populations adapt to natural or anthropogenic perturbations. \textcopyright{} 2009 The Royal Society.},

Many dinosaurs were oviparous, producing hard-shelled eggs, yet the reproductive system of dinosaurs has proven difficult to investigate, due to poor preservation of soft anatomy. In this study, we examined functional morphology and eggshell formation in a reptilian archosaur, the American alligator, and demonstrated that the crocodilian reproductive tract has separate uterine regions for formation of the eggshell membranes and calcareous layer. These uterine regions are ultrastructurally comparable to the isthmus and shell gland of birds, and may be homologous. This similarity of reproductive functional morphology between crocodilians and birds may implicate the evolution of an archosaurian mode of oviparity that may shed light on dinosaur reproduction.},

Forty-eight alligator holes in Water Conservation Area 3 of the central Everglades were sampled to assess variation in morphology and vegetation and to identify landscape- and habitat-level features that correlate to alligator-hole variation. Field observations and plant community ordination suggested three distinct categories of alligator holes: holes containing shrub/ tree species (shrub holes), holes surrounded by marsh (marsh holes), and holes dominated by cattails (cattail holes). Shrub holes were the most species-rich and diverse of the three types. All alligator holes except for cattail holes contained a greater richness of vascular plants than the surrounding marsh. Cattail holes were deeper than shrub or marsh holes, and all holes were deeper than surrounding marsh. Major landscape features that may influence structure of alligator holes seem to be distance from canals and surrounding marsh vegetation matrix. Alligator holes increase spatial heterogeneity, influence plant community composition and structure, and increase biological diversity. Restoration and management plans for the Everglades ecosystem should ensure that this landscape feature is perpetuated.},

Then, in a common gardening experiment, we compared zooplankton community composition when either experimentally adapted or D. magna from the original population were present. Local adaptation of D. magna significantly altered zooplankton community composition, leading to a suppression of abundances for some zooplankton taxa and facilitation for others. The effect size of D. magna adaptation was similar to that of adding fish or macrophytes to mesocosms, two important drivers of zooplankton community structure.

We hypothesized that importance of refuges in preventing population declines and alteration in community structure has a non-linear relationship with severity of disturbance. In the Florida Everglades, alligator ponds are used as refuge habitat by fishes during seasonal drying of marsh habitats. Using an 11-year record of hydrological conditions and fish abundance in 10 marshes and 34 alligator ponds from two regions of the Everglades, we sought to characterize patterns of refuge use and temporal dynamics of fish abundance and community structure across changing intensity, duration, and frequency of drought disturbance. Abundance in alligator ponds was positively related to refuge size, distance from alternative refugia (e. g. canals), and abundance in surrounding marsh prior to hydrologic disturbance. Variables negatively related to abundance in alligator ponds included water level in surrounding marsh and abundance of disturbance-tolerant species. Refuge community structure did not differ between regions because the same subset of species in both regions used alligator ponds during droughts. When time between disturbances was short, fish abundance declined in marshes, and in the region with the most spatially extensive pattern of disturbance, community structure was altered in both marshes and alligator ponds because of an increased proportion of species more resistant to disturbance. These changes in community structure were associated with increases in both duration and frequency of hydrologic disturbance. Use of refuge habitat had a modal relationship with severity of disturbance regime. Spatial patterns of response suggest that decline in refuge use was because of decreased effectiveness of refuge habitat in reducing mortality and providing sufficient time for recovery for fish communities experiencing reduced time between disturbance events.},

Estuarine wetlands in this heavily developed region, including foraging wetlands and fringe marshes surrounding nesting islands, are often dominated by Phragmitesaustralis. On Pea Patch Island in Delaware Bay, site of one of the largest and most enduring mixed-species heron colonies on the East Coast, wading birds nest in Phragmitesmarsh habitat as well as in adjacent upland shrubs and trees. Because Phragmitesis aggressively managed in Delaware Bay, we investigated the relative habitat value of marsh and upland nesting sites for the purpose of developing recommendations for marsh and wildlife man- agement. Utilization of marsh habitat by nesting birds ranged from 27-82\% during 1993-1998. Two species (great blue heron Ardea herodias and great egret A. alba) never nested in Phragmites,four species (little blue heron Egrettacaerulea, snowy egret E. thula, cattle egret Bubulcus ibis, and black-crowned night-heron Nycticoraxnycticorax)nested in approxi- mately equal proportions in both habitats, and one species (glossy ibis Plegadisfalcinellus) was largely confined to marsh nesting. Productivity (egg and nestling production) varied between habitats for some species. Cattle egrets produced larger clutches and had higher hatching rates in Phragmitescompared to upland habitat. Little blue herons were more successful in the uplands. Managers should retain Phragmitesmarsh at colony sites, such as Pea Patch Island, where it provides critical habitat for nesting wading birds both as substrate for nesting and buffer habitat to control human disturbance.},

Motivated by this, we use a quantitative genetics and LotkaVolterra framework to understand the impact of eco-evolutionary feedbacks on an intraguild predation community in which the intraguild predator evolves between a phenotype specialized for attacking its competitor (the intraguild prey) and a phenotype specialized for attacking a common resource. We show that evolution can drive both sudden and gradual shifts in community structure. Evolutionary rescue of the community, in which evolution prevents the loss of species, occurs in two ways: (i) selection to a particular phenotype that supports coexistence and (ii) continuous evolution between preyand resource-specialist phenotypes that support communitylevel Red Queen dynamics in which the community fluctuates between preyand predator-dominated states. Paradoxically, the predator can evolve to extirpate itself from the community provided that the ecological dynamics support bistability. Strong trade-offs between specialist phenotypes can lead to trait-based alternative states of the community resembling either a food chain or exploitative competition. Finally, we show that rapid evolution can stabilize equilibria that are unstable for the ecological dynamics, whereas slow evolution can stabilize equilibria that are unstable for the evolutionary dynamics. Our results demonstrate that eco-evolutionary feedbacks can drive shifts in community structure and that the overall dynamics depend on the trade-off strength and evolutionary rate.},

By altering the interactions within a community, eco-evolutionary feedbacks may play a role in community stability. Indeed, recent empirical and theoretical studies demonstrate that these feedbacks can stabilize or destabilize communities and, moreover, that this sometimes depends on the relative rate of ecological to evolutionary processes. So far, theory on how eco-evolutionary feedbacks impact stability exists only for a few special cases. In our work, we develop a general theory for determining the effects of eco-evolutionary feedbacks on stability in communities with an arbitrary number of interacting species and evolving traits for when evolution is slow and fast. We characterize how eco-evolutionary feedbacks lead to stable communities that would otherwise be unstable, and vice versa. Additionally, we show how one can identify the roles of direct and indirect feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes on stability and how the effects of those feedbacks depend on the rate of evolution relative to the ecological timescales. Applying our methods to models of competing species and food chains, we demonstrate how the functional form of trade-offs, genetic correlations between traits, and the rate of evolution determine whether eco-evolutionary feedbacks stabilize or destabilize communities.},

At a larger scale, within ecological communities, there is diversity in species. A number of studies have investigated how diversity at these two scales influence each other through what has been termed eco-evolutionary feedbacks. Here we study a three-species ecological module called apparent competition, in which the predator is evolving in a trait that determines its interaction with two prey species. Unlike previous studies on apparent competition, which employed evolutionary frameworks with very simple genetics, we study an eco-evolutionary model in which the predator's trait is determined by two recombining diallelic loci, so that its mean and variance can evolve, as well as associations (linkage disequilibrium) between the loci. We ask how eco-evolutionary feedbacks with these two loci affect the coexistence of the prey species and the maintenance of polymorphisms within the predator species. We uncover a novel eco-evolutionary feedback between the prey densities and the linkage disequilibrium between the predator's loci. Through a stability analysis, we demonstrate how these feedbacks affect polymorphisms at both loci and, among others, may generate stable cycling.},

However, the influence on invasions of phenotypic plasticity, a key component of many species interactions, is unknown. We present a model in which phenotypic plasticity of a resident species increases its ability to oppose invaders, and plasticity of an invader increases its ability to displace residents. Whereas these effects are expected due to increased fitness associated with phenotypic plasticity, the model additionally reveals a new and unforeseen mechanism by which plasticity affects invasions: phenotypic plasticity increases the steepness of the fitness surface, thereby making invasion more difficult, even by phenotypically plastic invaders. Our results should apply to phenotypically plastic responses to any fluctuating environmental factors including predation risk, and to other factors that affect the fitness surface such as the generalism of predators. We extend the results to competition, and argue that phenotypic plasticity's effect on the fitness surface will destabilize coexistence at local scales, but stabilize coexistence at regional scales. Our study emphasizes the need to incorporate variable interaction strengths due to phenotypic plasticity into invasion biology and ecological theory on competition and coexistence in fragmented landscapes. \textcopyright{} 2006 Peacor et al.},

We experimented with a model natural community in laboratory microcosms that allowed us to quantify the strength of priority effects for most of the yeast species found in the floral nectar of a hummingbirdpollinated shrub at a biological preserve in northern California. We found that priority effects were widespread, with late-arriving species experiencing strong negative effects from early-arriving species. However, the magnitude of priority effects varied across species pairs. This variation was phylogenetically non-random, with priority effects stronger between closer relatives. Analysis of carbon and amino acid consumption profiles indicated that competition between closer relatives was more intense owing to higher ecological similarity, consistent with Darwin's naturalization hypothesis. These results suggest that phylogenetic relatedness between potential colonists may explain the strength of priority effects and, as a consequence, the degree to which community assembly is historically contingent. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Royal Society.},

Here we examine how a particular pattern of temporal variation\textemdash periodic pulses of immi-gration\textemdash influences adaptation to a harsh environment, in which a species experiences conditions outside its niche requirements. Using both deterministic models and stochastic individual-based simulations, we show that for many ecological and genetic scenarios, temporally spacing out immigration events increases the probability that local adaptation is sufficient for persistence (i.e., niche evolution). When immigration events are too frequent, gene flow can hamper local adaptation in sexual species, but sufficiently infrequent pulses of immigration allow for repeated opportunities for adaptation with temporary escapes from gene flow during which local selection is unleashed. We develop versions of our models with and without density dependence for three different assumptions about the genetics underlying fitness (haploid, diploid, and quantitative genetic variation) so that our results may be applicable to a wide range of natural systems. Our study adds to a growing body of literature showing that temporal variation in migration rates can have significant effects on local adaptation and is among the first to show how such variation affects niche evolution.},

Despite a century of research on the evolution of karyotype, however, we still have little understanding of the evolutionary forces that enable chromosomal fusions and fissions to become established. Here, we compare the rates of chromosomal fusions between sex chromosomes (X, Y, Z, and W chromosomes) and autosomes. We find that these fusions more frequently involve the Y chromosome than other sex chromosomes in fishes and squamate reptiles. To account for these observations, we conduct theoretical analyses and find that the most likely explanation for this pattern is that fusions have deleterious effects, and further that mutation rates and/or sex ratios are biased. Improving our knowledge of the evolutionary mechanisms driving sex chromosome-autosome fusions provides a richer understanding of the forces that shape chromosomes generally.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION:Cys(2)His(2) zinc finger (ZF) proteins represent the largest class of eukaryotic transcription factors. Their modular structure and well-conserved protein-DNA interface allow the development of computational approaches for predicting their DNA-binding preferences even when no binding sites are known for a particular protein. The 'canonical model' for ZF protein-DNA interaction consists of only four amino acid nucleotide contacts per zinc finger domain. RESULTS:We present an approach for predicting ZF binding based on support vector machines (SVMs). While most previous computational approaches have been based solely on examples of known ZF protein-DNA interactions, ours additionally incorporates information about protein-DNA pairs known to bind weakly or not at all. Moreover, SVMs with a linear kernel can naturally incorporate constraints about the relative binding affinities of protein-DNA pairs; this type of information has not been used previously in predicting ZF protein-DNA binding. Here, we build a high-quality literature-derived experimental database of ZF-DNA binding examples and utilize it to test both linear and polynomial kernels for predicting ZF protein-DNA binding on the basis of the canonical binding model. The polynomial SVM outperforms previously published prediction procedures as well as the linear SVM. This may indicate the presence of dependencies between contacts in the canonical binding model and suggests that modification of the underlying structural model may result in further improved performance in predicting ZF protein-DNA binding. Overall, this work demonstrates that methods incorporating information about non-binding and relative binding of protein-DNA pairs have great potential for effective prediction of protein-DNA interactions.

Here we introduce a method for predicting DNA-binding specificities for Cys2His2 zinc fingers (C2H2-ZFs), the largest family of DNA-binding proteins in metazoans. We develop a general approach, based on empirical calculations of pairwise amino acid-nucleotide interaction energies, for predicting position weight matrices (PWMs) representing DNA-binding specificities for C2H2-ZF proteins. We predict DNA-binding specificities on a per-finger basis and merge predictions for C2H2-ZF domains that are arrayed within sequences. We test our approach on a diverse set of natural C2H2-ZF proteins with known binding specificities and demonstrate that for {$>$}85\% of the proteins, their predicted PWMs are accurate in 50\% of their nucleotide positions. For proteins with several zinc finger isoforms, we show via case studies that this level of accuracy enables us to match isoforms with their known DNA-binding specificities. A web server for predicting a PWM given a protein containing C2H2-ZF domains is available online at http://zf.princeton.edu and can be used to aid in protein engineering applications and in genome-wide searches for transcription factor targets.},

If native organisms can adapt to the presence of the invader, the severity of impact will decline with time. In Australia, invasive cane toads (\emph{Bufo marinus}) are highly toxic to most snakes that attempt to eat them. Because snakes are gape-limited predators with strong negative allometry for head size, maximum relative prey mass (and thus, the probability of eating a toad large enough to be fatal) decreases with an increase in snake body size. Thus, the arrival of toads should exert selection on snake morphology, favoring an increase in mean body size and a decrease in relative head size. We tested these predictions with data from specimens of four species of Australian snakes, collected over \&gt;80 years. Geographic information system layers provided data on the duration of toad exposure for each snake population, as well as environmental variables (latitude, precipitation, and temperature). As predicted, two toad-vulnerable species (\emph{Pseudechis porphyriacus} and \emph{Dendrelaphis punctulatus}) showed a steady reduction in gape size and a steady increase in body length with time since exposure to toads. In contrast, two species at low risk from toads (\emph{Hemiaspis signata} and \emph{Tropidonophis mairii}) showed no consistent change in these morphological traits as a function of the duration of toad exposure. These results provide strong evidence of adaptive changes in native predators as a result of the invasion of toxic prey.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We have moved from variation for plasticity being considered as a nuisance in evolutionary studies to it being the primary target of investigations that use an array of methods, including quantitative and molecular genetics, as well as of several approaches that model the evolution of plastic responses. Here, I consider some of the major aspects of research on phenotypic plasticity, assessing where progress has been made and where additional effort is required. I suggest that some areas of research, such the study of the quantitative genetic underpinning of plasticity, have been either settled in broad outline or superseded by new approaches and questions. Other issues, such as the costs of plasticity are currently at the forefront of research in this field, and are likely to be areas of major future development. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In this volume, primatologists, linguists, anthropologists, cognitive scientists and philosophers of science systematically analyze how their specific disciplines demarcate the research questions and methodologies involved in the study of the evolutionary origins of social communication in primates in general and in humans in particular. In the first part of the book, historians and philosophers of science address how the epistemological frameworks associated with primate communication and language evolution studies have changed over time and how these conceptual changes affect our current studies on the subject matter. In the second part, scholars provide cutting-edge insights into the various means through which primates communicate socially in both natural and experimental settings. They examine the behavioral building blocks by which primates communicate and they analyze what the cognitive requirements are for displaying communicative acts. Chapters highlight cross-fostering and language experiments with primates, primate mother-infant communication, the display of emotions and expressions, manual gestures and vocal signals, joint attention, intentionality and theory of mind. The primary focus of the third part is on how these various types of communicative behavior possibly evolved and how they can be understood as evolutionary precursors to human language. Leading scholars analyze how both manual and vocal gestures gave way to mimetic and imitational protolanguage and how the latter possibly transitioned into human language. In the final part, we turn to the hominin lineage, and anthropologists, archeologists and linguists investigate what the necessary neurocognitive, anatomical and behavioral features are in order for human language to evolve and how language differs from other forms of primate communication.},

Much emphasis is placed on the use of graphical displays at the various phases of the model-building process, starting with exploratory plots of the data and concluding with diagnostic plots to assess the adequacy of a fitted model. The NLME library for analyzing mixed-effects models in S and S-PLUS, developed by the authors, provides the underlying software for implementing the methods presented. This balanced mix of real data examples, modeling software, and theory makes the book a useful reference for practitioners who use, or intend to use, mixed-effects models in their data analyses.

  abstract = {Saurochory (seed dispersal by reptiles) among crocodilians has largely been ignored, probably because these reptiles are generally assumed to be obligate carnivores incapable of digesting vegetable proteins and polysaccharides. Herein we review the literature on crocodilian diet, foraging ecology, digestive physiology and movement patterns, and provide additional empirical data from recent dietary studies of Alligator mississippiensis. We found evidence of frugivory in 13 of 18 (72.2\%) species for which dietary information was available, indicating this behav- ior is widespread among the Crocodylia. Thirty-four families and 46 genera of plants were consumed by crocodilians. Fruit types consumed by crocodilians varied widely; over half (52.1\%) were fleshy fruits. Some fruits are consumed as gastroliths or ingested incidental to prey capture; however, there is little doubt that on occasion, fruit is deliberately consumed, often in large quantities. Sensory cues involved in crocodilian frugivory are poorly understood, although airborne and waterborne cues as well as surface disturbances seem important. Crocodilians likely accrue nutritional benefits from frugivory and there are no a priori reasons to assume otherwise. Ingested seeds are regurgitated, retained in the stomach for indefinite and often lengthy periods, or passed through the digestive tract and excreted in feces. Chemical and mechanical scarification of seeds probably occurs in the stomach, but what effects these processes have on seed viability remain unknown. Because crocodilians have large territories and undertake lengthy movements, seeds are likely transported well beyond the parent plant before being voided. Little is known about the ultimate fate of seeds ingested by crocodilians; however, deposition sites could prove suitable for seed germination. Although there is no evidence for a crocodilian-specific dispersal syndrome similar to that described for other reptiles, our review strongly suggests that crocodilians func- tion as effective agents of seed dispersal. Crocodilian saurochory offers a fertile ground for future research.},

Under standard conditions, X-linked diversity is expected to be three-quarters the level of autosomal diversity. Empirical data often deviate from this prediction, but the reasons for these departures are unclear. We demonstrate that population size changes can greatly alter relative levels of X-linked and autosomal variation: population size reductions lead to particularly low X-linked diversity, whereas growth elevates X-linked relative to autosomal diversity. Genetic variation from a diverse array of taxa supports an important role for this effect in accounting for population differences in the ratio of X-linked to autosomal diversity. Consideration of this effect may improve the inference of population history and other evolutionary processes.},

Temporal differences in composition and caloric contents of largemouth bass stomach contents were apparent. Most diet indices provided similar assessments when diets were dominated by a single prey type (i.e., gizzard shad during June-October). However, diet indices evaluated provided dissimilar assessments of stomach contents when a variety of prey with differing caloric densities were consumed (e.g., April). Mean stomach fullness and percent by volume were significantly (p {$<$} 0.002) correlated (r = 0.94 - 1.00) with mean caloric contribution of largemouth bass stomach contents during all months. Unlike percent by weight, mean stomach fullness accounted for differences in fish size and stomach capacity. Thus, mean stomach fullness by prey type appears to be the most appropriate index when objectives include simplified caloric-based assessments of fish diets},

In temporally and spatially varying habitats, non-neutral polymorphism could be maintained by heterozygote advantage across environments (marginal overdominance), which could be greatly increased by beneficial reversal of dominance across conditions. We tested for reversal of dominance and marginal overdominance in salinity tolerance in the saltwater-to-freshwater invading copepod Eurytemora affinis. We compared survival of F1 offspring generated by crossing saline and freshwater inbred lines (between-salinity F1 crosses) relative to within-salinity F1 crosses, across three salinities. We found evidence for both beneficial reversal of dominance and marginal overdominance in salinity tolerance. In support of reversal of dominance, survival of between-salinity F1 crosses was not different from that of freshwater F1 crosses under freshwater conditions and saltwater F1 crosses under saltwater conditions. In support of marginal overdominance, between-salinity F1 crosses exhibited significantly higher survival across salinities relative to both freshwater and saltwater F1 crosses. Our study provides a rare empirical example of complete beneficial reversal of dominance associated with environmental change. This mechanism might be crucial for maintaining genetic variation in salinity tolerance in E. affinis populations, allowing rapid adaptation to salinity changes during habitat invasions.},

Although Least Bitterns (Ixobrychus exilis) often nest solitarily, in a South Carolina impoundment they frequently associated with colonies of Boat-tailed grackles (Quiscalus major). Bittern nests inside and outside colonies occupied the same microhabitats. However, more bitterns nested in grackle colonies than in equal-sized areas of equivalent habitat in the same marsh. In one of two years, colonial bitterns had higher reproductive success than bitterns nesting outside colonies. We conclude that Least Bitterns actively associate with grackles. Possible reasons for the association of bitterns with grackles are as follows (1) Critical density effect: at high population densities, the advantages of dispersed (cryptic) nesting are lost. Bitterns switching to nest in groups may experience little reduction in reproductive success, relative to those nesting solitarily. (2) Vigilance and mobbing: grackles provide early warning, and actively exclude predatory birds from colonies. Bitterns nesting among grackles appeared to incur few costs, such as may result from competition for food or from intracolony predation.},

Reciprocal interactions between ecology and evolution, eco-evolutionary feedbacks, are less well studied, even though they may be critical for understanding the evolution of biological diversity, the structure of communities and the function of ecosystems. Eco-evolutionary feedbacks require that populations alter their environment (niche construction) and that those changes in the environment feed back to influence the subsequent evolution of the population. There is strong evidence that organisms influence their environment through predation, nutrient excretion and habitat modification, and that populations evolve in response to changes in their environment at time-scales congruent with ecological change (contemporary evolution). Here, we outline how the niche construction and contemporary evolution interact to alter the direction of evolution and the structure and function of communities and ecosystems. We then present five empirical systems that highlight important characteristics of eco- evolutionary feedbacks: rotifer-algae chemostats; alewife-zooplankton interactions in lakes; guppy life-history evolution and nutrient cycling in streams; avian seed predators and plants; and tree leaf chemistry and soil processes. The alewife-zooplankton system provides the most complete evidence for eco- evolutionary feedbacks, but other systems highlight the potential for eco- evolutionary feedbacks in a wide variety of natural systems.},

In at least one ectotherm, females of the New Zealand common gecko, Hoplodactylus maculatus, this variation in baseline (not stress-induced) corticosterone appears to be correlated with variation in body temperature (Tb). We tested the hypothesis that elevated corticosterone affects thermoregulatory behavior so as to raise Tb and that, independently of an increase in Tb, corticosterone increases metabolic rate. Compared with geckos receiving placebo implants, those that received implants containing corticosterone displayed heat-seeking behaviors, had a higher mean Tb in their home cages, and, at one time of day, selected a higher mean Tb in a thermal gradient. At a constant Tb, corticosterone-treated geckos consumed oxygen at a rate approximately 50\% higher than placebo geckos.

Contemporary genetic studies demonstrate that adaptation to novel environments can occur within 20 generations or less, indicating that evolutionary processes can influence invasiveness. However, the source of genetic or epigenetic variation underlying these changes remains uncharacterised. Here, we review the potential for rapid adaptation from standing genetic variation and from new mutations, and examine four types of evolutionary change that might promote or constrain rapid adaptation during the invasion process. Understanding the source of variation that contributes to adaptive evolution in invasive plants is important for predicting future invasion scenarios, identifying candidate genes involved in invasiveness, and, more generally, for understanding how populations can evolve rapidly in response to novel and changing environments.},

Ant-plant symbioses are classic examples of protection mutualisms: myrmecophytic plants provide nesting space and food for symbiotic ants in exchange for ant defense. Ant defense should thus reduce the abundance of herbivores, but studies of ant-plant symbioses usually measure damage to the plant without quantifying the herbivores themselves. In this study, we investigated whether geographic variation in the quality of ant defense in a symbiotic mutualism between Cordia alliodora trees and Azteca ants was associated with the abundance and species richness of plant herbivore communities. In three tropical-dry-forest sites in Middle America, we found that the density of Azteca ants within trees was negatively associated with the levels of leaf herbivory. At sites where ants were effective tree defenders, tree herbivores were less abundant and herbivore assemblages on trees exhibited lower species richness than at a site where ants were poor defenders. In addition, in a site where ants reduced herbivory, herbivore communities were less abundant and diverse in the presence of ants than in their absence, where as in a site where ants did not reduce herbivory, there were no differences in herbivore abundance or richness between trees with or without ants. We conclude that geographic variation in the quality of ant defense drives variation in myrmecophytic-plant herbivore communities. Moreover, ant-plant protection mutualisms should have important but rarely considered effects on herbivore population dynamics and food-plant specialization.},

  abstract = {Background: The rapid development of the (meta-)omics fields has produced an unprecedented amount of high-resolution and high-fidelity data. Through the use of these datasets we can infer the role of previously functionally unannotated proteins from single organisms and consortia. In this context, protein function annotation can be described as the identification of regions of interest (i.e., domains) in protein sequences and the assignment of biological functions. Despite the existence of numerous tools, challenges remain in terms of speed, flexibility, and reproducibility. In the big data era, it is also increasingly important to cease limiting our findings to a single reference, coalescing knowledge from different data sources, and thus overcoming some limitations in overly relying on computationally generated data from single sources. Results: We implemented a protein annotation tool, Mantis, which uses database identifiers intersection and text mining to integrate knowledge from multiple reference data sources into a single consensus-driven output. Mantis is flexible, allowing for the customization of reference data and execution parameters, and is reproducible across different research goals and user environments. We implemented a depth-first search algorithm for domain-specific annotation, which significantly improved annotation performance compared to sequence-wide annotation. The parallelized implementation of Mantis results in short runtimes while also outputting high coverage and high-quality protein function annotations. Conclusions: Mantis is a protein function annotation tool that produces high-quality consensus-driven protein annotations. It is easy to set up, customize, and use, scaling from single genomes to large metagenomes. Mantis is available under the MIT license at https://github.com/PedroMTQ/mantis.},

The largest cat in the Americas, it has survived an onslaught of environmental and human threats partly because of an evolutionary history unique among wild felines, but also because of a power and indomitable spirit so strong, the jaguar has shaped indigenous cultures and the beliefs of early civilizations on two continents.In An Indomitable Beast: The Remarkable Journey of the Jaguar, big-cat expert Alan Rabinowitz shares his own personal journey to conserve a species that, despite its past resilience, is now on a slide toward extinction if something is not done to preserve the pathways it prowls through an ever-changing, ever-shifting landscape dominated by humans. Rabinowitz reveals how he learned from newly available genetic data that the jaguar was a single species connected genetically throughout its entire range from Mexico to Argentina, making it unique among all other large carnivores in the world. In a mix of personal discovery and scientific inquiry, he sweeps his readers deep into the realm of the jaguar, offering fascinating accounts from the field. Enhanced with maps, tables, and color plates, An Indomitable Beast brings important new research to life for scientists, anthropologists, and animal lovers alike.This book is not only about jaguars, but also about tenacity and survival. From the jaguar we can learn better strategies for saving other species and also how to save ourselves when faced with immediate and long-term catastrophic changes to our environment.},

During 1990--9l, invertebrates were collected from replicate sweep and core samptes at eight sites along the nutrient enrichment gradient in Water Conservation Area 2A (WCA-2A). Species richness, Shannon's diversity, the number of unique species, and the density of invertebrates and small fish were all greater within enriched and intermediately enriched open water habitats than unenriched sloughs. Sorenson's taxonomic similarity index was significantly different between enriched and unenriched areas. Ostracods in particular were 14 times more abundant in the enriched area than at unenriched sites. The freshwater shrimp (Palaemonetespaludosus) was the only common species with lower densities in enriched than unenriched areas. However, the trophic structure or percent composition ofgrazers, predators, and collector-gatherersand the number \&species within taxonomic orders and functional feeding groups was very similar among sites along the nutrient enrichment gradient. Higher invertebrate and small fish diversity and density within enriched sites indicates that nutrient enrich- ment has not caused direct harmful foodweb effects that may adversely influence higher trophic levels (e.g., wading birds). Assuming, however, that nutrients can cause cattails to overgrow and eliminate sloughs, the centers of biological diversity in the Everglades, then nutrient enrichment may have harmful indirect effects.},

  abstract = {Ecological networks of two interacting guilds of species, such as flowering plants and pollinators, are common in nature, and studying their structure can yield insights into their resilience to environmental disturbances. Here we develop analytical methods for exploring the strengths of interactions within bipartite networks consisting of two guilds of phylogenetically related species. We then apply these methods to investigate the resilience of a plant-pollinator community to anticipated climate change. The methods allow the statistical assessment of, for example, whether closely related pollinators are more likely to visit plants with similar relative frequencies, and whether closely related pollinators tend to visit closely related plants. The methods can also incorporate trait information, allowing us to identify which plant traits are likely responsible for attracting different pollinators. These questions are important for our study of 14 prairie plants and their 22 insect pollinators. Over the last 70 years, six of the plants have advanced their flowering, while eight have not. When we experimentally forced earlier flowering times, five of the six advanced-flowering species experienced higher pollinator visitation rates, whereas only one of the eight other species had more visits; this network thus appears resilient to climate change, because those species with advanced flowering have ample pollinators earlier in the season. Using the methods developed here, we show that advanced-flowering plants did not have a distinct pollinator community from the other eight species. Furthermore, pollinator phylogeny did not explain pollinator community composition; closely related pollinators were not more likely to visit the same plant species. However, differences among pollinator communities visiting different plants were explained by plant height, floral color, and symmetry. As a result, closely related plants attracted similar numbers of pollinators. By parsing out characteristics that explain why plants share pollinators, we can identify plant species that likely share a common fate in a changing climate. \textcopyright{} 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.},

  abstract = {Background: Performing high throughput sequencing on samples pooled from different individuals is a strategy to characterize genetic variability at a small fraction of the cost required for individual sequencing. In certain circumstances some variability estimators have even lower variance than those obtained with individual sequencing. SNP calling and estimating the frequency of the minor allele from pooled samples, though, is a subtle exercise for at least three reasons. First, sequencing errors may have a much larger relevance than in individual SNP calling: while their impact in individual sequencing can be reduced by setting a restriction on a minimum number of reads per allele, this would have a strong and undesired effect in pools because it is unlikely that alleles at low frequency in the pool will be read many times. Second, the prior allele frequency for heterozygous sites in individuals is usually 0.5 (assuming one is not analyzing sequences coming from, e.g. cancer tissues), but this is not true in pools: in fact, under the standard neutral model, singletons (i.e. alleles of minimum frequency) are the most common class of variants because P(f ) {$\propto$} 1/f and they occur more often as the sample size increases. Third, an allele appearing only once in the reads from a pool does not necessarily correspond to a singleton in the set of individuals making up the pool, and vice versa, there can be more than one read \textendash{} or, more likely, none \textendash{} from a true singleton. Results: To improve upon existing theory and software packages, we have developed a Bayesian approach for minor allele frequency (MAF) computation and SNP calling in pools (and implemented it in a program called snape): the approach takes into account sequencing errors and allows users to choose different priors. We also set up a pipeline which can simulate the coalescence process giving rise to the SNPs, the pooling procedure and the sequencing. We used it to compare the performance of snape to that of other packages. Conclusions: We present a software which helps in calling SNPs in pooled samples: it has good power while retaining a low false discovery rate (FDR). The method also provides the posterior probability that a SNP is segregating and the full posterior distribution of f for every SNP. In order to test the behaviour of our software, we generated (through simulated coalescence) artificial genomes and computed the effect of a pooled sequencing protocol, followed by SNP calling. In this setting, snape has better power and False Discovery Rate (FDR) than the comparable packages samtools, PoPoolation, Varscan : for N = 50 chromosomes, snape has power {$\approx$} 35\% and FDR {$\approx$} 2.5\%. snape is available at code.google.com/p/snape-pooled/ (source code and precompiled binaries).},

Understanding the macroevolutionary processes generating this richness requires a historical perspective, but the fossil record of hexapods is patchy and incomplete. Dated molecular phylogenies provide an alternative perspective on divergence times and have been combined with birth-death models to infer patterns of diversification across a range of taxonomic groups. Here we generate a dated phylogeny of hexapod families, based on previously published sequence data and literature derived constraints, in order to identify the broad pattern of macroevolutionary changes responsible for the composition of the extant hexapod fauna. The most prominent increase in diversification identified is associated with the origin of complete metamorphosis, confirming this as a key innovation in promoting insect diversity. Subsequent reductions are recovered for several groups previously identified as having a higher fossil diversity during the Mesozoic. In addition, a number of recently derived taxa are found to have radiated following the development of flowering plant (angiosperm) floras during the mid-Cretaceous. These results reveal that the composition of the modern hexapod fauna is a product of a key developmental innovation, combined with multiple and varied evolutionary responses to environmental changes from the mid Cretaceous floral transition onward.},

Included are expressions in the functional domain of such classics as linear regression, principal components analysis, linear modeling, and canonical correlation analysis, as well as specifically functional techniques such as curve registration and principal differential analysis. Data arising in real applications are used throughout for both motivation and illustration, showing how functional approaches allow us to see new things, especially by exploiting the smoothness of the processes generating the data. The data sets exemplify the wide scope of functional data analysis; they are drawn from growth analysis, meteorology, biomechanics, equine science, economics, and medicine. The book presents novel statistical technology, much of it based on the authors own research work, while keeping the mathematical level widely accessible. It is designed to appeal to students, to applied data analysts, and to experienced researchers; it will have value both within statistics and across a broad spectrum of other fields. This second edition is aimed at a wider range of readers, and especially those who would like to apply these techniques to their research problems. It complements the authors' other volume Applied Functional Data Analysis: Methods and Case Studies. In particular, there is an extended coverage of data smoothing and other matters arising in the preliminaries to a functional data analysis. The chapters on the functional linear model and modeling of the dynamics of systems through the use of differential equations and principal differential analysis have been completely rewritten and extended to include new developments. Other chapters have been revised substantially, often to give more weight to examples and practical considerations.},

In absence of geographical barriers to dispersal, this adaptive divergence (AD) may be constrained by gene flow (GF). And yet the reverse may also be true, with AD constraining GF (i.e. \^Oecological speciation\~O). Both of these causal effects have frequently been inferred from the presence of negative correlations between AD and GF in nature \textendash yet the bi-directional causality warrants caution in such inferences. We discuss how the ability of correlative studies to infer causation might be improved through the simultaneous measurement of multiple ecological and evolutionary variables. On the one hand, inferences about the causal role of GF can be made by examining correlations between AD and the potential for dispersal. On the other hand, inferences about the causal role of AD can be made by examining correlations between GF and environmental differences. Experimental manipulations of dispersal and environmental differences are a particularly promising approach for inferring causation. At present, the best studies find strong evidence that GF constrains AD and some studies also find the reverse. Improvements in empirical approaches promise to eventually allow general inferences about the relative strength of different causal interactions during adaptive diversification.},

Pairwise genetic differentiation (F-ST) between populations ranged from 0.000 to 0.129 (average 0.021) and was statistically significant (P {$<$} 0.01). Mantel tests revealed that the effect of geographic distance on gene flow was not important (R-2 = -0.21, ns). There were no significant differences in allele frequencies between temporal samples from a given population. The examination of principal component scores (PCA) derived from allelic frequencies among populations suggests that disturbed habitats (in particular, a town) represent a barrier to gene flow. This means anthropogenic changes to landscape structures might promote genetic differentiation among hybridising shrew populations. We conclude that in the studied hybrid zone landscape structure may have stronger effect on gene flow than chromosomal incompatibilities.},

Both the sympathetic nervous system response and the regulation and reactivity of the hypothalamic\textendash pituitary\textendash adrenal (HPA) axis are discussed. In particular, we describe how the activity of the HPA axis at baseline levels follows circadian and circannual rhythms in ways that allow animals to respond to predictable environmental changes, focusing largely on the endpoint of this axis, the glucocorticoid hormones cortisol and corticosterone. Superimposed upon these rhythms are the elevated glucocorticoid levels characteristic of the stress response, which allow an animal to respond to unpredictable social, physical, or environmental challenges. Methods used to explore the stress response in free-ranging mammals are described. Both inter- and intraspecific variation in the stress response as they relate to the environment are discussed.

Through analysis of 384 whole killifish genome sequences and comparative transcriptomics in four pairs of sensitive and tolerant populations, we identify the aryl hydrocarbon receptor\textendash based signaling pathway as a shared target of selection. This suggests evolutionary constraint on adaptive solutions to complex toxicant mixtures at each site. However, distinct molecular variants apparently contribute to adaptive pathway modification among tolerant populations. Selection also targets other toxicity-mediating genes and genes of connected signaling pathways; this indicates complex tolerance phenotypes and potentially compensatory adaptations. Molecular changes are consistent with selection on standing genetic variation.

Population density is one potential mediator of such interactions because high population densities can impact the ecosystem and reduce resource availability. At present, such interactions are best known from theory and laboratory experiments. Here we quantify the importance of such interactions in nature by transplanting guppies from a stream where they co-occur with predators into tributaries that previously lacked both guppies and predators. If guppies evolve solely because of the immediate reduction in mortality rate, the strength of selection and rate of evolution should be greatest at the outset and then decline as the population adapts to its new environment. If indirect effects caused by the increase in guppy population density in the absence of predation prevail, then there should be a lag in guppy evolution because time is required for them to modify their environment. The duration of this lag is predicted to be associated with the environmental modification caused by guppies. We observed a lag in life-history evolution associated with increases in population density and altered ecology. How guppies evolved matched predictions derived from evolutionary theory that incorporates such density effects.},

However, little of this research has explored variation at microgeographic scales because it has often been assumed that high rates of gene flow will prevent adaptive divergence at fine spatial scales. Here, we establish a quantitative definition of microgeographic adaptation based on Wright's dispersal neighborhood that standardizes dispersal abilities, enabling this measure to be compared across species. We use this definition to evaluate growing evidence of evolutionary divergence at fine spatial scales. We identify the main mechanisms known to facilitate this adaptation and highlight illustrative examples of microgeographic evolution in nature. Collectively, this evidence requires that we revisit our understanding of the spatial scale of adaptation and consider how microgeographic adaptation and its driving mechanisms can fundamentally alter ecological and evolutionary dynamics in nature.},

  abstract = {Analysis of distribution patterns of land birds in the West Indies supports the empirical theory that once species invade islands they progress through a series of evolutionary changes that eventually greatly increase the probability of extinction. Species are arbitrarily assigned to four stages of the "taxon cycle" based on their distribution and differentiation within islands: (I) expanding or widespread, with little differentiation into morphologically distinct populations; (II) widespread but highly differentiated; (III) restricted, usually with a fragmented range; and (IV) endemic to one island. These stages are shown, beyond reasonable doubt, to represent a temporal sequence. Immigration has been observed to occur very rapidly, and expanding species usually reach most islands in a stepping-stone fashion. Recent colonists usually belong to species that are abundant and distributed in open habitats on the mainland. Once colonists reach islands, differentiation is usually rapid, although hampering effects of gene flow can be recognized. Changes in morphology and ecology also occur during the taxon cycle. In particular, habitat distributions are frequently restricted, often to mature forest. Extinction within recorded history has occurred with much higher frequency among Stage IV species than among species assigned to earlier stages. Slopes of species-area curves increase with stage of taxon cycle from 0.075 for Stage I species to 0.42 for Stage IV species, demonstrating that extinction rate is more sensitive to island size at progressively later stages of the cycle. Moreover, slopes vary with feeding behavior, from 0.04 for hummingbirds to 0.21 for flycatchers, swallows, and swifts. On the basis of these and other observations, we postulate that for a particular species the cycle results from progressively reduced competitive ability caused by counterevolution of the island biota toward that species. The cycle is driven by competition from newly arrived colonists that are initially free of a counteradaptive load. The presence of old populations on small remote islands rarely receiving new colonists attests to the importance of competition in the cycle. We expect groups with differing rates of immigration, differentiation, and extinction to exhibit different patterns of distribution among islands, but that suitable island groups, whose size and spatial patterns normalize these differences, can be found for any group of organisms. Moreover, the concept underlying the taxon cycle undoubtedly applies to mainland faunas and may help explain such patterns as variation in dominance and relative abundance of species.

  abstract = {Taxon cycles are sequential phases of expansion and contraction of the ranges of species, associated generally with shifts in ecological distribution. The important contribution of the taxon cycle to biogeographical analysis is its emphasis on evolutionary and ecological interactions among colonizing and resident species, which influence their extinction dynamics and establish patterns of geographical distribution. Taxon cycles were inferred originally from the distribution of species across island archipelagos, where a correlation was noted between gaps in island occupancy and the degree of phenotypic differentiation. This pattern implied that phases of colonization were followed by range contraction, while endemic Antillean species that were undifferentiated between islands suggested secondary expansion and the beginning of a new cycle. This interpretation was met with scepticism, but reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships from gene sequences has now permitted us to characterize taxon cycles in Lesser Antillean birds. The relative timing of phases of the cycle can be deduced from genetic divergence between island populations. We have found that taxon cycles have periods in the order of 106 years and that cycles in different lineages occur independently of each other and independently of Pleistocene climate cycles. Individual island populations may persist for several millions of years on the larger islands of the Lesser Antilles; occasional expansion phases lead to the replacement of island populations that have disappeared, thus reducing the archipelago-wide rate of extinction to nil. What drives taxon cycles is unknown, but we speculate that they may be caused by co-evolution with enemy populations, and a probable mechanism would involve infrequent mutations influencing parasite virulence and avian host disease resistance. Taxon cycles undoubtedly occur on continents, but the geographical configuration of island archipelagos reveals more clearly their presence and invites their study.},

  abstract = {The population component of a species' niche corresponds to the distribution of individuals across environments within a region. As evolutionary clades of species diversify, they presumably fill niche space, and, consequently, the rate of increase in species numbers slows. Total niche space and species numbers appear to be relatively stable over long periods, and so an increase in the species richness of one clade must be balanced by decrease in others. However, in several analyses, the total population niche space occupied per clade is independent of the number of species, suggesting that species in more diverse clades overlap more in niche space. This overlap appears to be accommodated by variation in the populations of each species, including their absence, within suitable niche space. I suggest that the uneven filling of niche space results from localized outcomes of the dynamic coevolutionary interactions of populations with their pathogens or other antagonists. Furthermore, I speculate that relationships with pathogens might constrain diversification if pathogen diversity increased with host diversity and resulted in more frequent host switching and emergent disease. Many indirect observations are consistent with these scenarios. However, the postulated influence of pathogens on the filling of niche space and diversification of clades primarily highlights our lack of knowledge concerning the space and time dimensions of coevolutionary interactions and their influence on population distribution and species diversification.},

  abstract = {Patterns of diversity within large regional biotas express the outcomes of processes, operating on both regional and local scales, that influence evolutionary diversification as well as the distribution and abundance of species. Regional analyses of species distributions suggest that neither ecological sorting of species based on their adaptations to the physical environment, nor interactions between competing species, adequately explain patterns of species richness. Potentially competing species appear to utilise broadly overlapping resources with similar proficiency. Phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses reveal that species abundances and distributions within regions vary independently of evolutionary relationship. This implies the existence of dynamic, species-specific controls on population growth, as could be applied by specialised pathogens or other antagonists. Here, I argue that the changing balance of coevolved interactions between hosts and their antagonists shapes the distribution and abundance of individual host populations as well as patterns of local species richness. Geographical expansion creates allopatric populations and thereby could promote diversification; contraction ultimately leads to extinction. This taxon-cycle dynamic links regional diversity and distribution to intrinsic biological interactions independently of extrinsic ecological conditions. These hypotheses emphasise the central importance of investigating the impacts of pathogens on species abundance and distribution, and the potential consequences of coevolutionary changes in pathogen-host relationships for species formation and extinction.},

The mutualism between the whistling thorn acacia (Acacia drepanolobium) and four species of symbiotic ants is an ecologically important one; ants strongly defend trees against elephants, which can otherwise have dramatic impacts on tree cover. In Laikipia, Kenya, the invasive big-headed ant (Pheidole megacephala) has established itself at numerous locations within the last 10\textendash 15 years. In invaded areas on five properties, we found that three species of symbiotic Crematogaster ants were virtually extirpated, whereas Tetraponera penzigi co-occurred with P. megacephala. T. penzigi appears to persist because of its nonaggressive behavior; in a whole-tree translocation experiment, Crematogaster defended host trees against P. megacephala, but were extirpated from trees within hours. In contrast, T. penzigi retreated into domatia and withstood invading ants for .30 days. In the field, the loss of defensive Crematogaster ants in invaded areas led to a five- to sevenfold increase in the number of trees catastrophically damaged by elephants compared to un-invaded areas. In savannas, tree cover drives many ecosystem processes and provides essential forage for many large mammal species; thus, the invasion of big-headed ants may strongly alter the dynamics and diversity of East Africa's whistling thorn savannas by disrupting this system's keystone acacia\textendash ant mutualism.},

The largest, free-living animal to inhabit the continent year-round is a flightless midge,               Belgica antarctica               . Larval midges survive the lengthy austral winter encased in ice, and when the ice melts in summer, the larvae complete their 2-yr life cycle, and the wingless adults form mating aggregations while subjected to surprisingly high substrate temperatures. Here we report a dichotomy in survival strategies exploited by this insect at different stages of its life cycle. Larvae constitutively up-regulate their heat shock proteins (small hsp, hsp70, and hsp90) and maintain a high inherent tolerance to temperature stress. High or low temperature exposure does not further up-regulate these genes nor does it further enhance thermotolerance. Such ``preemptive'' synthesis of hsps is sufficient to prevent irreversible protein aggregation in response to a variety of common environmental stresses. Conversely, adults exhibit no constitutive up-regulation of their hsps and have a lower intrinsic tolerance to high temperatures, but their hsps can be thermally activated, resulting in enhanced thermotolerance. Thus, the midge larvae, but not the adults, have adopted the unusual strategy of expressing hsps continuously, possibly to facilitate proper protein folding in a cold habitat that is more thermally stable than that of the adults but a habitat subjected frequently to freeze-thaw episodes and bouts of pH, anoxic, and osmotic stress.},

Recent studies indicate that high propagule vectors, such as ballast water and shellfish transplantations, and multiple introductions contribute to the elimination of founder effects in the majority of successful aquatic invasions. Multiple introductions, in particular, can promote range expansion of introduced populations through both genetic and demographic mechanisms. Closely related to vectors and corridors of introduction, propagule pressure can play an important role in determining the genetic outcome of introduction events. Even low-diversity introductions have numerous means of avoiding the negative impact of diversity loss. The interaction of high propagule vectors and multiple introductions reveal important patterns associated with invasion success and deserve closer scrutiny.},

  abstract = {Plasma levels of corticosterone are often used as a measure of "stress"in wild animal populations. However,we lack conclusive evidence that different stress levels reflect different survival probabilities between populations. Galapagos marine iguanas offer an ideal test case because island populations are affected differently by recurring El Ni\~no famine events, and population-level survival can be quantified by counting iguanas locally. We surveyed corticosterone levels in six populations during the 1998 El Ni\~no famine and the 1999 La Nifa feast period. Iguanas had higher baseline and handling stress-induced corticosterone concentrations during famine than feast conditions. Corticosterone levels differed between islands and predicted survival through an El Ni\~no period. However, among individuals, baseline corticosterone was only elevated when body condition dropped below a critical threshold. Thus, the population-level corticosterone response was variable but nevertheless predicted overall population health. Our results lend support to the use of corticosterone as a rapid quantitative predictor of survival in wild animal populations.},

Alligators {$>$}2.73 m total length (TL) were more cannibalistic than smaller alligators. Large alligators ({$>$}2.73 m) preyed almost exclusively on large juveniles and small adults (1.22-2.12 m TL). Medium-sized alligators (2.13-2.73 m TL) preyed principally on medium-sized juvenile alligators (0.75-1.20 m TL), while small alligators (1.35-2.12 m TL) preyed mainly on hatchlings and small juveniles ({$<$}0.75 m TL). Alligators {$<$}1.35 m TL were not cannibalistic. We consider cannibalism an important population regulating mechanism and estimated that cannibalism ac- counted for 50.2\% of total hatchling mortality and 63.7\% of total mortality in alligators of age 11 mo and older. Mortality due to cannibalism appeared to be distributed proportionately among all cohorts in the 0.35-2.12 m TL size classes, resulting in a relatively uniform reduction across the group; males and females were cannibalized in the same proportions as they occurred in the population. Cannibalism accounted for only a small part of each predator's diet. Total losses due to cannibalism were an estimated 2.13 prey alligators per potential predator in the standing crop per year.},

  abstract = {There are many striking examples of phenotypic convergence in nature, in some cases associated with changes in the same genes. But even mutations in the same gene may have different biochemical properties and thus different evolutionary consequences. Here we dissect the molecular mechanism of convergent evolution in three lizard species with blanched coloration on the gypsum dunes of White Sands, New Mexico. These White Sands forms have rapidly evolved cryptic coloration in the last few thousand years, presumably to avoid predation. We use cell-based assays to demonstrate that independent mutations in the same gene underlie the convergent blanched phenotypes in two of the three species. Although the same gene contributes to light phenotypes in these White Sands populations, the specific molecular mechanisms leading to reduced melanin production are different. In one case, mutations affect receptor signaling and in the other, the ability of the receptor to integrate into the melanocyte membrane. These functional differences have important ramifications at the organismal level. Derived alleles in the two species show opposite dominance patterns, which in turn affect their visibility to selection and the spatial distribution of alleles across habitats. Our results demonstrate that even when the same gene is responsible for phenotypic convergence, differences in molecular mechanism can have dramatic consequences on trait expression and ultimately the adaptive trajectory.},

Ecology of North American Freshwater Fishes is the only textbook to provide advanced undergraduate and graduate students and researchers with an up-to-date and integrated view of the ecological and evolutionary concepts, principles, and processes involved in the formation and maintenance of this fauna. Ecology of North American Freshwater Fishes provides readers with a broad understanding of why specific species and assemblages occur in particular places. Additionally, the text explores how individuals and species interact with each other and with their environments, how such interactions have been altered by anthropogenic impacts, and the relative success of efforts to restore damaged ecosystems. This book is designed for use in courses related to aquatic and fish ecology, fish biology, ichthyology, and related advanced ecology and conservation courses, and is divided into five sections for ease of use. Chapter summaries, supplemental reading lists, online sources, extensive figures, and color photography are included to guide readers through the material and facilitate student learning. Part 1: Faunal origins, evolution, and diversity Presents a broad picture\textemdash both spatially and temporally\textemdash of the derivation of the fauna, including global and regional geological and climatological processes and their effects on North American fishes. Part 2: Formation, maintenance, and persistence of local populations and assemblages Focuses on how local fish populations and assemblages are formed and how they persist, or not, through time. Part 3: Form and function Deals with the relationship of body form and life history patterns as they are related to ecological functions. Part 4: Interactions among individuals and species Discusses the numerous interactions among individuals and species through communication, competition, predation, mutualism, and facilitation. Part 5: Issues in conservation Focuses on several primary conservation issues such as flow alterations and the increasing biotic homogenization of faunas.},

  abstract = {A reasonably general theory for predicting the outcome of coevolution among interacting species is developed. It is applied to a model for resource partitioning among competing species. Current theory for resource partitioning is based on derivations of a "limiting similarity"-i.e., a limit to how similar competitors can be to one another consistent with coexistence. This theory presumes there is a mechanism, perhaps invasion and extinction, which causes competitors to attain the limiting similarity. The view taken in this paper is that partitioning is an evolutionary compromise between pressures for character displacement and disadvantages inherent in the shift to different resource types. A set of principles is offered for the evolution of the parameters in ecological models. (1) For single population models natural selection causes the parameters ultimately to assume those values which produce the highest equilibrium population size. (2) For models of interacting populations, but without interspecific frequency-dependence, natural selection causes the parameters to assume values which produce either the highest or lowest equilibrium population size for any species depending on the sign of the "feedback" in the community obtained by deleting that species. (3) For models of interacting populations with interspecific frequency dependence natural selection leads to parameter values which produce intermediate equilibrium population sizes. A function called the conditional equilibrium population size is introduced. Provided (a) the mean fitness is a maximum in each species at a stable coevolutionary equilibrium and (b) there is negative density-dependence in each species then natural selection causes the parameters to assume values which produce the highest conditional equilibrium population size for each species. These coevolutionary principles, applied to a model for resource partitioning, entail that the niche separation between species relative to given niche widths, increases with the variety of available resources and decreases with the number of competing populations. Also, the evolution of character displacement between two species does not proceed far enough to maximize the equilibrium population sizes of the species involved. These results imply that the relationship between the niche overlap (of nearest neighbors) and species diversity is qualitatively different depending on whether the variety of resources at any place covaries with the species diversity there. Without covariation niche overlap increases with species diversity; with covariation overlap may decrease with species diversity. This study provides the beginning of a theory for the convergent evolution of community structure. \textcopyright{} 1976.},

  abstract = {Darwin was initially puzzled by the processes that led to ornamentation in males-what he termed sexual selection-and those that led to extreme cooperation and altruism in complex animal societies-what was later termed kin selection. Here, I explore the relationships between sexual and kin selection theory by examining how social competition for reproductive opportunities-particularly in females-and sexual conflict over mating partners are inherent and critical parts of complex altruistic societies. I argue that (i) patterns of reproductive sharing within complex societies can drive levels of social competition and reproductive conflict not only in males but also in females living in social groups, and ultimately the evolution of female traits such as ornaments and armaments; (ii) mating conflict over female choice of sexual partners can influence kin structure within groups and drive the evolution of complex societies; and (iii) patterns of reproductive sharing and conflict among females may also drive the evolution of complex societies by influencing kin structure within groups. Ultimately, complex societies exhibiting altruistic behaviour appear to have only arisen in taxa where social competition over reproductive opportunities and sexual conflict over mating partners were low. Once such societies evolved, there were important selective feedbacks on traits used to regulate and mediate intra-sexual competition over reproductive opportunities, particularly in females.},

  abstract = {Males figured more prominently than females in Darwin's view of sexual selection. He considered female choice of secondary importance to male-male competition as a mechanism to explain the evolution of male ornaments and armaments. Fisher later demonstrated the importance of female choice in driving male trait evolution, but his ideas were largely ignored for decades. As sexual selection came to embrace the notions of parent-offspring and sexual conflict, and experimental tests of female choice showed promise, females began to feature more prominently in the framework of sexual selection theory. Recent debate over this theory has centred around the role of females, not only over the question of choice, but also over female-female competition. Whereas some have called for expanding the sexual selection framework to encompass all forms of female-female competition, others have called for subsuming sexual selection within a broader framework of social selection, or replacing it altogether. Still others have argued for linking sexual selection more clearly to other evolutionary theories such as kin selection. Rather than simply debating terminology, we must take a broader view of the general processes that lead to trait evolution in both sexes by clearly defining the roles that females play in the process, and by focusing on intra- and inter-sexual interactions in males and females.},

In large, replicated field plots, we manipulated the mutualism between a dominant plant (Lolium arundinaceum) and symbiotic fungal endophyte (Neotyphodium coenophialum). The presence of the mutualism reduced arthropod abundance up to 70\%, reduced arthropod diversity nearly 20\%, shifted arthropod species composition relative to endophyte-free plots and suppressed the biomass and richness of other plant species in the community. Herbivorous arthropods were more strongly affected than carnivores, and for both herbivores and carnivores, effects of the mutualism appeared to propagate indirectly via organisms occurring more basally in the food web. The influence of the mutualism was as great or greater than previously documented effects of competition and predation on arthropod communities. Our work demonstrates that a keystone mutualism can significantly reduce arthropod biodiversity at a broad community scale.},

  abstract = {Direct observation of evolution in response to natural environmental change can resolve fundamental questions about adaptation, including its pace, temporal dynamics, and underlying phenotypic and genomic architecture. We tracked the evolution of fitness-associated phenotypes and allele frequencies genome-wide in 10 replicate field populations of               Drosophila melanogaster               over 10 generations from summer to late fall. Adaptation was evident over each sampling interval (one to four generations), with exceptionally rapid phenotypic adaptation and large allele frequency shifts at many independent loci. The direction and basis of the adaptive response shifted repeatedly over time, consistent with the action of strong and rapidly fluctuating selection. Overall, we found clear phenotypic and genomic evidence of adaptive tracking occurring contemporaneously with environmental change, thus demonstrating the temporally dynamic nature of adaptation.                        ,              Dynamic adaptation in fruit flies                            Ecosystems can experience rapid environmental change but whether populations can continuously adapt to those changes is unknown.

Combining a field experiment with laboratory common garden experiments, they observed changes in six phenotypes related to reproductive output or stress tolerance underlain by rapid, genome-wide evolution. The direction of trait and genomic shifts changed over months, in accordance with environmental changes. This study demonstrates the potential for rapid, continuous evolution to changing environmental conditions and highlights the importance of collecting data with a high temporal resolution for observing the effects of fluctuating selection. \textemdash BEL                        ,              Fruit flies show continuous adaptation to environmental changes from summer to autumn in the field.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Adaptation is a foundational process in evolutionary biology that is central to human health and the conservation of biodiversity. Adaptive tracking, defined as continuous adaptation in response to rapid environmental change, is a potentially critical mechanism by which populations persist in changing environments. However, little is known about the pace, extent, and magnitude of adaptive tracking in response to natural temporal variation. This may be attributable to the historical perception that adaptation occurs slowly relative to environmental change as well as to difficulties in measurement. Replicated field experiments that directly measure phenotypic and genomic evolution in response to ongoing environmental change could provide the resolution necessary to answer fundamental questions about the process of adaptation, including those about adaptive tracking. If adaptive tracking does occur in populations experiencing rapid environmental change, it would alter our understanding of the importance of evolutionary change for ecological outcomes.                                         RATIONALE                                The design of our field experiment focused on three key elements to study adaptive tracking in response to ongoing environmental change: (i) generating highly accurate measurements of phenotypic and genomic evolution, (ii) taking these measurements on a time scale similar to that of natural environmental change, and (iii) collecting measurements from independent replicate populations experiencing similar environmental conditions. Specifically, we directly measured phenotypic and genomic evolution in response to natural seasonal change across 10 independent replicate field populations, each comprising up to 100,000                 Drosophila melanogaster                 individuals. We measured the evolution of heritable phenotypes related to stress tolerance and reproductive output under typical laboratory conditions (repeated common-garden rearing) over monthly intervals from July to November 2014. Individuals collected at the same intervals from each population were used for full-genome pooled sequencing to measure genomic change over time. We specifically assessed the degree of parallel phenotypic and genomic change across replicate populations, as any parallelism would be strong evidence of the deterministic evolutionary process of adaptation. We further looked for reversals in the direction of adaptation over time, which would demonstrate variation in the direction of natural selection (termed fluctuating selection) and would provide strong evidence for adaptive tracking.                                                        RESULTS               We assayed phenotypic evolution of six fitness-associated phenotypes and genomic evolution at 1.9 million single-nucleotide polymorphic sites across the genome. We found clear evidence of parallel phenotypic and genomic evolution indicative of adaptive tracking. Phenotypic adaptation was pervasive and remarkably fast relative to measures of trait change from many prior studies. Moreover, the direction of evolution changed over time for development rate (a key component of reproductive output) and desiccation tolerance (an important trait in stress resistance). Similar patterns were observed in genomic data, with clear signatures of parallel allele frequency change across time intervals, including some that resulted from fluctuating selection. Genomic regions implicated in selection were found on all chromosomes, yet most were under selection over only a single time interval. At least 165 independent genomic regions were under selection during the experiment; allele frequencies at {$>$}60\% of variant sites genome-wide were shaped in part by selection. Taken together, these data underscore that natural selection is capable of driving evolution in multiple fitness-associated phenotypes and much of the genome even over short time scales.                                         CONCLUSION               Our experiment shows the feasibility of observing adaptive tracking in response to environmental change in real time using replicated field experiments. Our data from this approach support a model of adaptive tracking in which populations adapt in response to continuous environmental change, with selection acting on multiple phenotypes and tens to hundreds of genetic variants. The pronounced action of fluctuating selection suggests that evolutionary rates may be systematically underestimated and that fluctuating selection could be an underappreciated mechanism that maintains diversity. Determining whether adaptive tracking is a general feature of natural populations, and elucidating the mechanisms by which it occurs, could be transformative for understanding the generation and maintenance of biodiversity.                                                   Adaptation tracks ongoing environmental change.                                        We conducted a replicated longitudinal field experiment using outbred                     Drosophila                     populations to assess the phenotypic and genomic basis of adaptation in response to natural seasonal environmental change. We observed fast phenotypic adaptation in multiple phenotypes, parallel change in allele frequencies at dozens of independent loci, and reversals in the direction of adaptative evolution for some traits and loci over monthly time intervals.},

  abstract = {Members of several bacterial lineages are known only as symbionts of insects and move among hosts through maternal transmission. Such vertical transfer promotes strong fidelity within these associations, favoring the evolution of microbially mediated effects that improve host fitness. However, phylogenetic evidence indicates occasional horizontal transfer among different insect species, suggesting that some microbial symbionts retain a generalized ability to infect multiple hosts. Here we examine the abilities of three vertically transmitted bacteria from the Gammaproteobacteria to infect and spread within a novel host species, the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. Using microinjection, we transferred symbionts from three species of natural aphid hosts into a common host background, comparing transmission efficiencies between novel symbionts and those naturally infecting A. pisum. We also examined the fitness effects of two novel symbionts to determine whether they should persist under natural selection acting at the host level. Our results reveal that these heritable bacteria vary in their capacities to utilize A. pisum as a host. One of three novel symbionts failed to undergo efficient maternal transmission in A. pisum, and one of the two efficiently transmitted bacteria depressed aphid growth rates. Although these findings reveal that negative fitness effects and low transmission efficiency can prevent the establishment of a new infection following horizontal transmission, they also indicate that some symbionts can overcome these obstacles, accounting for their widespread distributions across aphids and related insects.},

How much of the coexistence observed in species-rich communities results from indirect effects among competitors that only emerge in diverse systems remains poorly understood. Resolving this issue requires simple, scalable, and intuitive metrics for quantifying the conditions for coexistence in multispecies systems, and how these conditions differ from those expected based solely on pairwise interactions. To achieve these aims, we develop a structural approach for studying the set of parameter values compatible with n-species coexistence given the geometric constraints imposed by the matrix of competition coefficients. We derive novel mathematical metrics analogous to stabilizing niche differences and fitness differences that measure the range of conditions compatible with multispecies coexistence, incorporating the effects of indirect interactions emerging in diverse systems. We show how our measures can be used to quantify the extent to which the conditions for coexistence in multispecies systems differ from those that allow pairwise coexistence, and apply the method to a field system of annual plants. We conclude by presenting new challenges and empirical opportunities emerging from our structural metrics of multispecies coexistence.},

  abstract = {With the exception of the biptanar articulation between the two sacral vertebrae, the adjoining vertebral bodies of extant crocodilians and other eusuchians form synovial, semi-spheroidal articulations. On each of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, the semi-spheroidal-shaped condyle is situated at the caudal end of the vertebral body, while the socket, in which the condyle of the following vertebra articulates, is at the cranial end; a condition that is described as procoelous. The body of the first caudal vertebra is biconvex, having a condyle at both ends. All the other caudal vertebrae are procoelous. As is the case in all crocodilians, both the cranial end of the body of the first sacral vertebra and caudal end of that belonging to the second sacral vertebra are concave. In contrast to eusuchians, the non-sacral vertebrae of most other crocodilians are amphicoelous, meaning that the vertebral body is concave at both ends. Procoelous vertebrae are also known to occur" in a some Cretaceous mesosuchians, namely Bernissartia fagesii, Gilchristosuchus palatinus and at least two species of atoposaurids. Additionally, in S. fagesii the body of the first caudal vertebra is biconvex, whereas in the atoposaurid Theriosuchus pusillus it is convex cranialiy and concave terminally; a condition that is described as opisthocoelous. Despite the systematic significance attached to these features, the reasons for the evolutionary transformation from amphicoelous to either procoelous or opisthocoelous vertebral bodies in crocodilians have never been addressed. A biomechanical model for the axial bracing mechanism of extant crocodilians indicates that during locomotion, the articulations between adjoining vertebral bodies must accommodate dorsoventral and transverse shear loads, together with rostroterminal torsion, compression and shear. In the context of this model, the main mechanical role played by procoelous vertebral bodies is stabilization of these articulations against dorsoventral and transverse shear loads. In the majority of fossil crocodilians with amphicoelous vertebrae, similar models suggest that the influence of dorsoventral and transverse shear loads on the articulations between adjoining vertebral bodies is minimal. This is due primarily to the stabilizing effect of peg-and-groove articulations between adjoining osteoderms of the paravertebral shield. A consequence of this type of bracing mechanism, however, is that lateral flexion of the trunk is considerably restricted, in those crocodilians with amphicoelous vertebrae and a paravertebral shield in which the lateral margins are open, the capacity for lateral flexion is increased, but stabilization of the articulations between adjoining vertebral bodies is problematic unless the animal is of a low mass or fully aquatic. Both procoely and opisthocoely, which most likely involve a more extensive ossification of either the caudal/terminal or cranial end of the vertebral body respectively, represent a mechanical solution to this problem. Similar to many other postcranial features considered characteristic of eusuchians, in the context of a biomechanical model for the axial bracing mechanism, the transformation to semi-spheroidal articulations between adjoining vertebral bodies from an initially biconcave condition can be reconstructed from a number of different fossil crocodilians. This suggests that the current preference for regarding the evolutionary origin of extant crocodilians and other eusuchians as being the result of a single, step-wise transformation process is problematic.},

  abstract = {Allochthonous marine input is a key component of the dynamics of islands and terrestrial coastal ecosystems on islands in the Gulf of California, Mexico, where an unproductive desert juxtaposes a highly productive ocean. In this area, seabirds are a major conduit bringing marine productivity to land. Seabirds leave guano on roosting and nesting islands, and carrion on nesting islands. We analyze how seabirds affect the abundance of a dominant consumer group, tenebrionid beetles, on 25 islands in the Gulf of California over a three-year period. Tenebrionid densities vary by three orders of magnitude among islands. Beetles are most abundant in areas influenced by seabirds: they are approximately five times more dense on nesting and roosting islands than on other islands and on mainland sites, and approximately six times more dense inside vs. outside colonies. Path analyses show that seabirds significantly affect beetles by two distinct pathways. On roosting islands, effects are mainly indirect: guano, a fertilizing nutrient, significantly enhances plant productivity; beetles eat plant detritus. On nesting islands, significant effects are primarily direct: beetles eat seabird carrion; the indirect pathway (guano and plants) contributes little on these islands. By providing energy and nutrients to fuel a diverse array of consumer populations, seabirds are central to the dynamics of these island ecosystems. Scavengers and avian parasites directly increase by eating seabird products. Likewise, populations of consumers that eat detritus, plant tissues, and seeds are enhanced indirectly via the fertilizing effects of guano on plants. Increases in these primary consumers indirectly facilitate high densities of many predators. Thus, consumer populations on these islands are deeply subsidized by substantial input from seabirds. Because consumers cannot influence the renewal rate of their allochthonous resources, the dynamics of these consumers and their food webs are largely donor controlled.},

In sites without the Argentine ant, native ant communities exhibit significant species segregation, consistent with competitive dynamics. In sites with the Argentine ant, native ant communities appear random or weakly aggregated in species co-occurrence. Comparisons of the same sites before and after invasion indicate that the shift from a structured to a random community is rapid and occurs within a year of invasion. Our results show that invasive species not only reduce biodiversity but rapidly disassemble communities and, as a result, alter community organization among the species that persist.},

We present, to our knowledge, the first global analysis of this extinction based on comprehensive country-level data on the geographical distribution of all large mammal species (more than or equal to 10 kg) that have gone globally or continentally extinct between the beginning of the Last Interglacial at 132 000 years BP and the late Holocene 1000 years BP, testing the relative roles played by glacial-interglacial climate change and humans. We show that the severity of extinction is strongly tied to hominin palaeobiogeography, with at most a weak, Eurasia-specific link to climate change. This first species-level macroscale analysis at relatively high geographical resolution provides strong support for modern humans as the primary driver of the worldwide megafauna losses during the late Quaternary.},

Anolis lizards vary extensively in their expression of cranial dimorphism. Compared with other Anolis species, members of the carolinensis clade have evolved relatively high levels of cranial dimorphism; males of this clade have exceptionally long faces relative to conspecific females. Developmentally, this facial length dimorphism arises through an evolutionarily novel, clade-specific strategy. Our analyses herein reveal that sex-specific regulation of the oestrogen pathway underlies evolution of this exaggerated male phenotype, rather than the androgen or insulin growth factor pathways that have long been considered the primary regulators of male-biased dimorphism among vertebrates. Our results suggest greater intricacy in the genetic mechanisms that underlie sexual dimorphisms than previously appreciated.},

  abstract = {The secretion of glucocorticoids (GCs) is a classic endocrine response to stress. Despite that, it remains controversial as to what purpose GCs serve at such times. One view, stretching back to the time of Hans Selye, posits that GCs help mediate the ongoing or pending stress response, either via basal levels of GCs permitting other facets of the stress response to emerge efficaciously, and/or by stress levels of GCs actively stimulating the stress response. In contrast, a revisionist viewpoint posits that GCs suppress the stress response, preventing it from being pathologically overactivated. In this review, we consider recent findings regarding GC action and, based on them, generate criteria for determining whether a particular GC action permits, stimulates, or suppresses an ongoing stress-response or, as an additional category, is preparative for a subsequent stressor. We apply these GC actions to the realms of cardiovascular function, fluid volume and hemorrhage, immunity and inflammation, metabolism, neurobiology, and reproductive physiology. We find that GC actions fall into markedly different categories, depending on the physiological endpoint in question, with evidence for mediating effects in some cases, and suppressive or preparative in others. We then attempt to assimilate these heterogeneous GC actions into a physiological whole.},

In forest trees, hardly any large-effect loci have been detected.Most animal studies have concentrated on adaptation based on distinct phenotypic polymorphisms, with monogenic or oligogenic inheritance. Genetic variation in polygenic traits has been less studied, but results on human height, for example, suggest small effects in many loci.Combining different phenotype and population genetics approaches using an explicit theoretical framework can provide strong total evidence even if individual methods are not conclusive, for example, when identifying loci under selection.},

  abstract = {A striking feature of the human genome is the dearth of CpG dinucleotides (CpGs) interrupted occasionally by CpG islands (CGIs), regions with relatively high content of the dinucleotide. CGIs are generally associated with promoters; genes, whose promoters are especially rich in CpG sequences, tend to be expressed in most tissues. However, all working definitions of what constitutes a CGI rely on ad hoc thresholds. Here we adopt a direct and comprehensive survey to identify the locations of all CpGs in the human genome and find that promoters segregate naturally into two classes by CpG content. Seventy-two percent of promoters belong to the class with high CpG content (HCG), and 28\% are in the class whose CpG content is characteristic of the overall genome (low CpG content). The enrichment of CpGs in the HCG class is symmetric and peaks around the core promoter. The broad-based expression of the HCG promoters is not a consequence of a correlation with CpG content because within the HCG class the breadth of expression is independent of the CpG content. The overall depletion of CpGs throughout the genome is thought to be a consequence of the methylation of some germ-line CpGs and their susceptibility to mutation. A comparison of the frequencies of inferred deamination mutations at CpG and GpC dinucleotides in the two classes of promoters using SNPs in human-chimpanzee sequence alignments shows that CpGs mutate at a lower frequency in the HCG promoters, suggesting that CpGs in the HCG class are hypomethylated in the germ line.},

These eco-evolutionary dynamics have been documented repeatedly in laboratory and mesocosm experiments. We show here that they are also important for understanding community functioning in a natural ecosystem. Daphnia is a major planktonic consumer influencing seasonal plankton dynamics in many lakes. It is also sensitive to succession in its phytoplankton food, from edible algae in spring to relatively inedible cyanobacteria in summer. We show for Daphnia mendotae in Oneida Lake, New York, United States, that within-year ecological change in phytoplankton (from spring diatoms, cryptophytes and greens to summer cyanobacteria) resulted in consumers evolving increasing tolerance to cyanobacteria over time. This evolution fed back on ecological seasonal changes in population abundance of this major phytoplankton consumer. Oneida Lake is typical of mesotrophic lakes broadly, suggesting that eco-evolutionary consumer-resource dynamics is probably common.},

Verifying this diagnosis is important because it implies a radically different view on management options, and on the potential effects of global change on such ecosystems. For instance, it implies that gradual changes in temperature or other factors might have little effect until a threshold is reached at which a large shift occurs that might be difficult to reverse. Strategies to assess whether alternative stable states are present are now converging in fields as disparate as desertification, limnology, oceanography and climatology. Here, we review emerging ways to link theory to observation, and conclude that although, field observations can provide hints of alternative stable states, experiments and models are essential for a good diagnosis.},

Here we show that self-organized clusters of look-a-likes may emerge spontaneously from coevolution of competitors. The explanation is that there are two alternative ways to survive together: being sufficiently different or being sufficiently similar. Using a model based on classical competition theory, we demonstrate a tendency for evolutionary emergence of regularly spaced lumps of similar species along a niche axis. Indeed, such lumpy patterns are commonly observed in size distributions of organisms ranging from algae, zooplankton, and beetles to birds and mammals, and could not be well explained by earlier theory. Our results suggest that these patterns may represent self-constructed niches emerging from competitive interactions. A corollary of our findings is that, whereas in species-poor communities sympatric speciation and invasion of open niches is possible, species-saturated communities may be characterized by convergent evolution and invasion by look-a-likes.},

This view, however, is incomplete because it does not acknowledge that predators may play a significant role in the delivery of critical life-support services such as ecosystem nutrient cycling. New research is beginning to show that predator effects on nutrient cycling are ubiquitous. These effects emerge from direct nutrient excretion, egestion or translocation within and across ecosystem boundaries after prey consumption, and from indirect effects mediated by predator interactions with prey. Depending on their behavioural ecology, predators can create heterogeneous or homogeneous nutrient distributions across natural landscapes. Because predator species are disproportionately vulnerable to elimination from ecosystems, we stand to lose much more from their disappearance than their simple charismatic attractiveness.},

Despite the ubiquity of phenotypic variation within natural populations, its effects on the dynamics of ecological communities are not well understood. Here, we use a quantitative genetics framework to examine how phenotypic variation in a predator affects the outcome of apparent competition between its two prey species. Classical apparent competition theory predicts that prey have reciprocally negative effects on each other. The addition of phenotypic trait variation in predation can marginalize these negative effects, mediate coexistence, or generate positive indirect effects between the prey species. Long-term coexistence or facilitation, however, can be preceded by long transients of extinction risk whenever the heritability of phenotypic variation is low. Greater heritability can circumvent these ecological transients but also can generate oscillatory and chaotic dynamics. These dramatic changes in ecological outcomes, in the sign of indirect effects, and in stability suggest that studies which ignore intraspecific trait variation may reach fundamentally incorrect conclusions regarding ecological dynamics. \textcopyright{} 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

This fluctuation-dependent coexistence mechanism requires three conditions: (i) there is a positive covariance between species responses to environmental conditions and the strength of competition, (ii) there are species-specific environmental responses, and (iii) species are less sensitive to competition in environmentally unfavorable years. In serially uncorrelated environments, condition (i) occurs only if favorable environmental conditions immediately and directly increase the strength of competition. For many demographic parameters, this direct link between favorable years and competition may not exist. Moreover, many environmental variables are temporal autocorrelated, but theory has largely focused on serially uncorrelated environments. To address this gap, a model of competing species in autocorrelated environments is analyzed. This analysis shows that positive autocorrelations in demographic rates that increase fitness (e.g., maximal fecundity or adult survival) produce the positive environment-competition covariance in condition (i). Hence, when these demographic rates contribute to buffered population growth, positive temporal autocorrelations generate a storage effect; otherwise, they destabilize competitive interactions. For negatively autocorrelated environments, this theory highlights an alternative stabilizing mechanism that requires three conditions: (i0) there is a negative environment-competition covariance, (ii) there are species-specific environmental responses, and (iii0 ) species are less sensitive to competition in more favorable years. When the conditions for either of these stabilizing mechanisms are violated, temporal autocorrelations can generate stochastic priority effects or hasten competitive exclusion. Collectively, these results highlight that temporal autocorrelations in environmental conditions can play a fundamental role in determining ecological outcomes of competing species.},

  abstract = {In nature, closely related species often interbreed to produce hybrids. However, hybrids are often less fertile or unable to compete with parent species, making them less likely to thrive in the wild. When the genomes of two different species are mixed, versions of genes that are meant to work together can become separated, which means that these genes do not work as well as they should. This reduces the hybrids' chances of survival, and a poor survival rate of hybrids is one barrier that keeps different species distinct, even though the species can interbreed. Two species of swordtail fish live in the rivers in Mexico, and although they mostly live in different stretches of these rivers, the two species interbreed to produce hybrids in the regions where they overlap. These hybrids can outnumber the parental species in these `hybrid zones', but the two species have remained separate in other parts of the rivers. Though some genetic incompatibilities that might keep the species distinct have previously been suggested, it is not known how many incompatibilities there are in these fish's genomes. Schumer et al. have searched the genomes of wild hybrids between these species and found hundreds of genetic incompatibilities. These were identified by looking for species-specific pairs of genes that are found together more often than would be expected if there were no selection against hybrids. It is likely that many of these incompatibilities reduce the evolutionary fitness of the hybrid fish and Schumer et al. suggest that many could be the result of environmental pressures and the fish's mating preferences. Furthermore, Schumer et al. demonstrate that genes close to identified incompatibilities are more different between species, on average, than genes that are further away. When there is on-going interbreeding between two the species (as is the case with the swordtails), this finding is expected only if these incompatibilities reduce the hybrids' chances of finding mates or surviving. The findings of Schumer et al. demonstrate how conflicts in the genomes of two species allow these species to remain distinct even when they live in overlapping environments and frequently interbreed. Future work will investigate how these genetic incompatibilities shape the hybrid populations that are found in the wild; and which incompatibilities are caused by poor survival of the hybrids or by the fish's mating preferences selecting against the hybrids.

We adopt a biological market approach to present a model for the evolution of resource exchange mutualisms, using the relationship between plants and mycorrhizal fungi as an example. We apply the economic theory of relative advantage to investigate the conditions under which species ought to specialize and trade. A simple economic analogy demonstrates that, in a two-resource model, a species that is relatively efficient at acquiring one resource would benefit from specialization on acquisition of that resource accompanied by trade for the other resource.

  abstract = {Both abiotic and biotic gradients exist in soils, and several of these gradients have been shown to select for plant traits. Moreover, plants possess a multitude of traits that can lead to strong niche construction (i.e. plant-induced changes to soils). Our objectives in this paper are to outline both empirical and theoretical evidence for the evolutionary consequences of plant-soil linkages and feedbacks on plants along soil heterogeneity gradients. We describe a simple mathematical model of plant evolution to explore the relationship between the sign and magnitude of feedback and the divergence of plant traits. We also constructed an individual-based simulation model to study the conditions under which plant-soil feedbacks occur, niche construction evolves, and plant traits diverge. This approach allows us to address specific hypotheses regarding relationships between positive and negative plant-soil feedback with variation in niche construction, the strength of selective gradients and the relative importance of local adaptation vs. feedbacks. The models suggest that feedbacks between soils and plants may commonly result in evolutionary interactions. The simulation model indicates that plant traits can diverge with niche construction and traits can be selected for in response to niche construction. However, the magnitude of feedbacks and how strongly they evolve depends on the amount of gene flow and the strength of selective gradients over time. These results suggest that plant-soil feedback can lead to evolution in plants and reveals new research directions for further inquiry. Questions addressing trade-offs and relationships between positive and negative feedbacks as well as adaptation and maladaptation of plant traits represent important frontiers in plant-soil feedback studies. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Authors.

The molecule's selective toxicity toward the beetle's fungal antagonist, combined with the prevalence and localization of its bacterial source, indicates an insect-microbe association that is both mutualistic and coevolved. This unexpected finding in a well-studied system indicates that mutualistic associations between insects and antibiotic-producing bacteria are more common than currently recognized and that identifying their small-molecule mediators can provide a powerful search strategy for therapeutically useful antimicrobial compounds.},

  abstract = {Thermally-induced changes in heart rate and blood flow in reptiles are believed to be of selective advantage by allowing animal to exert some control over rates of heating and cooling. This notion has become one of the principal paradigms in reptilian thermal physiology. However, the functional significance of changes in heart rate is unclear, because the effect of heart rate and blood flow on total animal heat transfer is not known. I used heat transfer theory to determine the importance of heat transfer by blood flow relative to conduction. I validated theoretical predictions by comparing them with field data from two species of lizard, bearded dragons (Pogona barbata) and lace monitors (Varanus varius). Heart rates measured in free-ranging lizards in the field were significantly higher during heating than during cooling, and heart rates decreased with body mass. Convective heat transfer by blood flow increased with heart rate. Rates of heat transfer by both blood flow and conduction decreased with mass, but the mass scaling exponents were different. Hence, rate of conductive heat transfer decreased more rapidly with increasing mass than did heat transfer by blood flow, so that the relative importance of blood flow in total animal heat transfer increased with mass. The functional significance of changes in heart rate and, hence, rates of heat transfer, in response to heating and cooling in lizards was quantified. For example, by increasing heart rate when entering a heating environment in the morning, and decreasing heart rate when the environment cools in the evening a Pogona can spend up to 44 min longer per day with body temperature within its preferred range. It was concluded that changes in heart rate in response to heating and cooling confer a selective advantage at least on reptiles of mass similar to that of the study animals (0.21\textendash 5.6 kg).},

The aim of this study was to describe the diving behaviour of the freshwater crocodile Crocodylus johnstoni in the wild and to assess the relationships between diving, body temperature, and heart rate. Time-depth recorders, temperature-sensitive radio transmitters, and heart rate transmitters were deployed on each of six C. johnstoni (4.0-26.5 kg), and data were obtained from five animals. Crocodiles showed the greatest diving activity in the morning (0600-1200 hours) and were least active at night, remaining at the water surface. Surprisingly, activity pattern was asynchronous with thermoregulation, and activity was correlated to light rather than to body temperature. Nonetheless, crocodiles thermoregulated and showed a typical heart rate hysteresis pattern (heart rate during heating greater than heart rate during cooling) in response to heating and cooling. Additionally, dive length decreased with increasing body temperature. Maximum diving length was 119.6 min, but the greatest proportion of diving time was spent on relatively short ({$<$}45 min) and shallow ({$<$}0.4 m) dives. A bradycardia was observed during diving, although heart rate during submergence was only 12\% lower than when animals were at the surface.},

  abstract = {Speciation is a central and fundamental process in evolution that concerns the origin of reproductive isolation. The latest generation of genomic approaches provide remarkable opportunities to describe speciation and to learn about its underlying mechanisms.Genome scans, which can now be carried out in a truly genome-wide scale and at base-pair resolution, reveal substantial genomic divergence among incipient species even in the face of gene flow and show that there is extensive genomic heterogeneity in the extent of differentiation, especially at early stages of speciation, both in sympatry and in allopatry.The sources of this heterogeneity remain incompletely understood. The combination of genome scans with sophisticated population genetic modelling, quantitative trait locus mapping, admixture analyses and ecology has the potential to distinguish the influence of selection from demographic, historical and structural effects and to link these sources of genomic divergence to phenotypes and to reproductive isolation.Available empirical data suggest that differentiation between parapatric populations can be restricted to few genomic islands, whereas incipient species that coexist in sympatry show differentiation that is widely distributed across the genome. This suggests that genomically widespread selection is required to permit the maintenance and perhaps the build-up of genetic differentiation in sympatry.Recent genomic studies reveal that the genetic basis of reproductive isolation is often complex. The effects of pleiotropy, genetic correlations and patterns of recombination need to be considered alongside effects of ecological and sexual selection as well as genomic conflict.A surprising recent discovery is the re-use of ancient genetic variants in speciation, which are acquired either from standing genetic variation or by introgressive hybridization.In this Review, we propose a 'roadmap' for the development of speciation genomics towards answering classical and emerging questions in speciation research.},

In 1 area in northeastern Illinois, pairs of boxes were erected on posts over water; in an adjacent area, boxes were mounted singly on trees in deciduous woodlands. Traditionally placed boxes (visible duplexes) were parasitized more often than non-traditionally placed (hidden, dispersed) boxes (72\% vs. 35\%; P{$<$} 0.001) and received more parasitic eggs/clutch ((\$) over bar x = 6.2 eggs vs. 1.2 eggs; P {$<$} 0.001). Over 4 years, parasitism rates nearly tripled among traditionally placed boxes but remained low among non-traditionally placed boxes despite similar box use (87\% vs. 84\%, respectively). Eggs laid in traditionally placed boxes were less likely to hatch than those laid in non-traditionally placed boxes (45\% vs. 64\%; P {$<$} 0.001), a direct result of extreme brood parasitism (dump nesting). Although the same number of ducklings was produced/box (9.0 vs. 9.2 ducklings from visible and hidden boxes, respectively), 10.9 eggs remained unhatched/traditionally placed box versus only 4.4 unhatched eggs/non-traditionally placed box. Parasitism was highest early in the nesting season when most boxes were unoccupied, and there were no correlations (P {$>$} 0.05) between number of unoccupied nest boxes available/week and proportion of parasitized clutches/week in either study area. Our results show (1) a clear relationship between nest box placement and frequency of brood parasitism, (2) rarity of unoccupied boxes does not determine rate of parasitism, and (3) extreme brood parasitism reduces reproductive efficiency. We suggest that if nest boxes are distributed in inconspicuous sites, local wood duck populations will more likely achieve their full reproductive potential.},

However, such models rarely include estimates of interspecific interactions among explanatory variables. We tested the importance of such variables by using the peregrine falcon Falco peregrinus, a medium-sized raptor frequently reported to be affected by heterospecifics, as a model species. In an Alpine population, compared to random locations, peregrines selected breeding sites farther from conspecifics, on taller cliffs, with higher availability of farmland and closer to raven Corvus corax nests. Within suitable habitat, peregrines selected sites near ravens and far from elevations associated with golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos nests. Productivity increased with cliff size, farmland availability (rich in the local main prey) and with proximity to ravens, suggesting that the observed choices were adaptive. Finally, at the regional level, peregrine density peaked at low elevation and was positively associated with raven density. The results suggested an active breeding association of peregrines with ravens, which may provide early-warning cues against predators and safe alternative nest-sites. They also confirmed the importance of including estimates of interspecific interactions among explanatory variables, which may: 1) make models more realistic; 2) increase their predictive power by lowering unexplained variance due to unmeasured factors; 3) provide unexpected results such as the cryptic, large-scale breeding association of our study; and 4) stimulate further hypothesis formulation and testing, ultimately leading to deeper ecological knowledge of the study system.},

The exponent is significantly higher than 0.75, so does not conform to quarter-power scaling theory, but rather is likely an emergent property with no single explanation. SMR at 1 kg body mass is similar to the literature for C. porosus and for alligators. The high exponent is not related to feeding, growth, or obesity of captive animals. The log-transformed data appear slightly curved, mainly because SMR is somewhat low in many of the largest animals (291-389 kg). A 3-parameter model is scarcely different from the linear one, but reveals a declining exponent between 0.862 and 0.798. A non-linear model on arithmetic axes overestimates SMR in 70\% of the smallest animals and does not satisfactorily represent the data.},

  abstract = {Inertial homeothermy, the maintenance of a relatively constant body temperature that occurs simply because of large size, is often applied to large dinosaurs. Moreover, biophysical modelling and actual measurements show that large crocodiles can behaviourally achieve body temperatures above 30\textdegree C. Therefore it is possible that some dinosaurs could achieve high and stable body temperatures without the high energy cost of typical endotherms. However it is not known whether an ectothermic dinosaur could produce the equivalent amount of muscular power as an endothermic one. To address this question, this study analyses maximal power output from measured aerobic and anaerobic metabolism in burst exercising estuarine crocodiles, Crocodylusporosus, weighing up to 200 kg. These results are compared with similar data from endothermic mammals. A 1 kg crocodile at 30\textdegree C produces about 16 watts from aerobic and anaerobic energy sources during the first 10\% of exhaustive activity, which is 57\% of that expected for a similarly sized mammal. A 200 kg crocodile produces about 400 watts, or only 14\% of that for a mammal. Phosphocreatine is a minor energy source, used only in the first seconds of exercise and of similar concentrations in reptiles and mammals. Ectothermic crocodiles lack not only the absolute power for exercise, but also the endurance, that are evident in endothermic mammals. Despite the ability to achieve high and fairly constant body temperatures, therefore, large, ectothermic, crocodile-like dinosaurs would have been competitively inferior to endothermic, mammal-like dinosaurs with high aerobic power. Endothermy in dinosaurs is likely to explain their dominance over mammals in terrestrial ecosystems throughout the Mesozoic.},

To enable rapid human genome assembly, we present Shasta, a de novo long-read assembler, and polishing algorithms named MarginPolish and HELEN. Using a single PromethION nanopore sequencer and our toolkit, we assembled 11 highly contiguous human genomes de novo in 9\,d. We achieved roughly 63\texttimes{} coverage, 42-kb read N50 values and 6.5\texttimes{} coverage in reads {$>$}100\,kb using three flow cells per sample. Shasta produced a complete haploid human genome assembly in under 6\,h on a single commercial compute node. MarginPolish and HELEN polished haploid assemblies to more than 99.9\% identity (Phred quality score QV\,=\,30) with nanopore reads alone. Addition of proximity-ligation sequencing enabled near chromosome-level scaffolds for all 11 genomes. We compare our assembly performance to existing methods for diploid, haploid and trio-binned human samples and report superior accuracy and speed.},

Tolerance to complete desiccation in this species is associated with the emergence of multiple paralogs of protective genes. One of the gene families highly expressed under anhydrobiosis and involved in this process are protein-L-isoaspartate (D-aspartate) O-methyltransferases (PIMTs). Recently, a closely related anhydrobiotic midge from Malawi,             P. pembai             , showing the ability to tolerate complete desiccation similar to that of             P. vanderplanki             , but experiences more frequent desiccation-rehydration cycles due to differences in ecology, was discovered. Here, we sequenced and assembled the genome of             P. pembai             and performed a population genomics analysis of several populations of             P. vanderplanki             and a population of             P. pembai.             We observe positive selection and radical changes in the genetic architecture of the             PIMT             locus between the two species, including multiple duplication events in the             P. pembai             lineage. In particular,             PIMT-4             , the most highly expressed of these             PIMTs             , is present in six copies in the             P. pembai             ; these copies differ in expression profiles, suggesting possible sub- or neofunctionalization. The nucleotide diversity ({$\pi$}) of the genomic region carrying these new genes is decreased in             P. pembai             , but not in the orthologous region carrying the ancestral gene in             P. vanderplanki             , providing evidence for a selective sweep associated with post-duplication adaptation in the former. Overall, our results suggest an extensive recent and likely ongoing, adaptation of the mechanisms of anhydrobiosis.},

  abstract = {Explaining the coexistence of multiple species in the competition and predation theatre has proven a great challenge. Traditional intraguild predation (IGP) models have only relatively small regions of stable coexistence of all species. Here, we investigate potential additional mechanisms that extend these regions of stable coexistence. We used a 3-species Lotka-Volterra system to which we added an interaction term to model a unidirectional facilitative relationship between the two predators in the IGP. In this modelling study the IG predator was able to precondition a part of the common resource by an instantaneous manipulation, which resulted in the immobilization of the resource species. This mechanism of immobilization facilitated the resource uptake by the IG prey and thus increased its growth rates even in the presence of the common predator. The facilitative relationship of the IG prey by the IG predator produced a stable coexistence of both predators even though the IG prey was an inferior competitor for a common resource, which cannot be attained with the traditional IGP models. Furthermore, our model predicted a 3-species stable coexistence even at high enrichment where no coexistence was found in the basic IGP model. Thus, we showed that diversity of resource traits could significantly alter emergent community patterns via shifts in exploitative competition of IGP-related predators. The described mechanism could potentially lead to a higher efficiency in exploitation of common resources and thus promote higher diversity in a real community.

Such influence is generally observed as phylogenetic signal, in which trait similarity is a function of evolutionary relationships, or phylogenetic niche conservatism, in which clades of species exhibit a single trait value. These patterns are observed so often in ecological research that the lack of phylogenetic influence on a system should be viewed as an exception to the rule. This special feature showcases research at the cutting edge of phylogenetic analysis of biotic interactions. Eight papers address three dominant questions: (a) What determines which species associate with each other? (b) How does evolutionary history constrain adaptation in response to interactions? (c) How does evolutionary history influence community, ecosystem, and global ecological processes and patterns? The interactions studied include symbioses such the mycorrhiza and the lichen, plant\textendash soil interactions and herbivory. Synthesis: Phylogenetics presents important perspectives and tools to understand fundamental ecological processes. Among the most in need of research are geographic patterns in interaction strength and commonness, such as the latitudinal gradient in herbivory; the relationship between rapid evolution and evolutionary history, and the interaction of the two onto community and ecosystem processes and patterns; and the influence of evolutionary history on outcome in conservation problems and management.},

Here, we integrate modern coexistence theory and food web theory to simultaneously quantify the relative importance of predation and environmental fluctuations for species coexistence. We first examine coexistence in a theoretical, multitrophic model, adding complexity to the food web using machine learning approaches. We then apply our framework to a stochastic model of the rocky intertidal food web, partitioning empirical coexistence dynamics. We find the main effects of both environmental fluctuations and variation in predator abundances contribute substantially to species coexistence. Unexpectedly, their interaction tends to destabilise coexistence, leading to new insights about the role of bottom-up vs. top-down forces in both theory and the rocky intertidal ecosystem.},

Our observations on Cumberland Island, Georgia, revealed regular predation on deer and other mammals by large ({$>$} 1.8m total length) alligators (Alligator mississippiensis). Alligator fecal samples and gut contents, and observations of mammalian carcasses in alligator holes showed that terrestrial mammals composed a significant proportion of large alligator diets. Such regular feeding on terrestrial mammals may affect terrestrial community structure. The ecological importance of large numbers of adult alligators has not been stressed, perhaps because numbers were reduced prior to modern ecological studies. Alligator harvest programs target large individuals, thereby continually modifying both size structure of alligator populations and the potential impact of alligators on terrestrial community structure.},

  abstract = {Can biodiversity evolve and persist in a uniform environment? This question is at the heart of the plankton paradox: in the natural world we observe many species sharing few resources, whereas the principle of competitive exclusion would lead us to expect that only a few species could coexist in such circumstances. To bridge the gap between theory and observation, previous studies have shown that the maximum number of species that can stably coexist is equal to the number of essential resources and that even more species can coexist out of equilibrium. These studies were viewed as a significant step toward a resolution of the paradox. Evolutionary dynamics, however, have been studied in this context only in limited cases, and it is largely unknown how mutations impact ecologically stable multispecies states, and whether large species consortia can spontaneously evolve. In the present study we introduce evolution to the standard ecological model of competition for essential resources. Combining numeric and analytic approaches, we find that ecologically stable species communities are severely destabilized by long-term evolutionary dynamics. Moreover, the number of species in spontaneously evolved consortia is much lower than the number of available resources. Contrary to expectations based on studies of two resources, these limits on biodiversity are not results of the occasional emergence of superspecies, superior to all competitors; nor are they alleviated by the inclusion of tradeoffs in resource utilization. Rather, we show that it is an accelerated depletion of limiting resources, combined with the essentiality of resources to all species, that leads invariably to catastrophic extinctions. \textcopyright{} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

One possible explanation for the disparity is that local ASE are difficult to maintain regionally in patch dynamic models. Here we examine two possible mechanisms for regional coexistence of species engaged in local ASE. Biotically generated heterogeneity (e.g., habitat modification that favors further invasion by conspecifics) results in regional exclusion of one species at equilibrium. In contrast, abiotic heterogeneity due to spatial variation in resource supply ratios generates local-scale ASE and ensures regional coexistence with sufficiently broad environmental gradients. Abiotic heterogeneity can result in a species that is the dominant competitor over some of its range being excluded if the area where it is dominant is too small. Biotic heterogeneity can lead to alternative stable landscapes or regional priority effects, while abiotic heterogeneity results in regional determinism. Broad environmental gradients in resource supply favor regional coexistence of species that exhibit local ASE. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We estimated this relationship for 1780 time series of mammals, birds, fish, and insects. We found that rates of population growth are high at low population densities but, contrary to previous predictions, decline rapidly with increasing population size and then flatten out, for all four taxa. This produces a strongly concave relationship between a population's growth rate and its size. These findings have fundamental implications for our understanding of animals' lives, suggesting in particular that many animals in these taxa will be found living at densities above the carrying capacity of their environments.},

Here, we used experimental and observational approaches to assess stabilizing forces in eight locally co-occurring, annual, legume species in the genus Trifolium. We experimentally measured self-limitation in the field by transplanting Trifolium species into each other's field niches while varying competition and related these patterns to the field coexistence dynamics of natural Trifolium populations. We found that Trifolium species differed in their responses to local environmental gradients and performed best in their home environments, consistent with habitat specialization and presenting a possible barrier to coexistence at fine scales. We found significant self-limitation for 5 of 42 pairwise species combinations measured experimentally with competitors absent, indicating stabilization through plant\textendash soil feedbacks and other indirect interactions, whereas self-limitation was largely absent when neighbors were present, indicating destabilizing effects of direct plant\textendash plant interactions. The degree of self-limitation measured in our field experiment explained year-to-year dynamics of coexistence by Trifolium species in natural communities. By assessing stabilizing forces and environmental responses in the full n-dimensional field niche, this study sheds light on the roles of habitat specialization, plant\textendash soil feedbacks, and plant interactions in determining species coexistence at local scales.},

  abstract = {Recent studies suggest that populations and species often exhibit behavioral syndromes; that is, suites of correlated behaviors across situations. An example is an aggression syndrome where some individuals are more aggressive, whereas others are less aggressive across a range of situations and contexts. The existence of behavioral syndromes focuses the attention of behavioral ecologists on limited (less than optimal) behavioral plasticity and behavioral carryovers across situations, rather than on optimal plasticity in each isolated situation. Behavioral syndromes can explain behaviors that appear strikingly non-adaptive in an isolated context (e.g. inappropriately high activity when predators are present, or excessive sexual cannibalism). Behavioral syndromes can also help to explain the maintenance of individual variation in behavioral types, a phenomenon that is ubiquitous, but often ignored. Recent studies suggest that the behavioral type of an individual, population or species can have important ecological and evolutionary implications, including major effects on species distributions, on the relative tendencies of species to be invasive or to respond well to environmental change, and on speciation rates. Although most studies of behavioral syndromes to date have focused on a few organisms, mainly in the laboratory, further work on other species, particularly in the field, should yield numerous new insights.},

One intriguing possibility is that variation in cognition is functionally related to variation in personality.

Our hypotheses are based largely on a connection between fast-slow behavioural types (BTs; e.g. boldness, aggressiveness, exploration tendency) and cognitive speed-accuracy trade-offs. We also discuss connections between BTs, cognition and ecologically important aspects of decision-making, including sampling, impulsivity, risk sensitivity and choosiness.

The rise and demise of these branches (clades) are ultimately determined by changes in speciation and extinction rates, often interpreted as a response to varying abiotic and biotic factors. However, understanding the relative importance of these factors remains a major challenge in evolutionary biology. Here we analyze the rich North American fossil record of the dog family Canidae and of other carnivores to tease apart the roles of competition, body size evolution, and climate change on the sequential replacement of three canid subfamilies (two of which have gone extinct). We develop a novel Bayesian analytic framework to show that competition from multiple carnivore clades successively drove the demise and replacement of the two extinct canid subfamilies by increasing their extinction rates and suppressing their speciation. Competitive effects have likely come from ecologically similar species from both canid and felid clades. These results imply that competition among entire clades, generally considered a rare process, can play a more substantial role than climate change and body size evolution in determining the sequential rise and decline of clades.},

Recent research has shown a major short-term advantage of sex in aphids to be purely ecological: the production of cold-resistant eggs. However, this is unlikely to be the only force acting to maintain sex in aphids. In the past five years, theoretical developments and the accumulation of ecological and molecular data have greatly advanced understanding of the genetic and evolutionary consequences of reproductive modes in aphids and their distributions in nature, and they have provided tools that promise to make aphids important organisms with which to examine general advantages of sex.},

In addition to its obligatory symbiont Buchnera aphidicola , the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum harbors several facultative symbionts influencing several aspects of host ecology. Aphids reproduce by cyclical parthenogenesis whereby clonal and sexual reproduction alternate within the annual life cycle. Many species, including the pea aphid, also show variation in their reproductive mode at the population level, with some lineages reproducing by cyclical parthenogenesis and others by permanent parthenogenesis. While the role of facultative symbionts has been well studied during the parthenogenetic phase of their aphid hosts, very little is known on their possible influence during the sexual phase. Here we investigated whether facultative symbionts modulate the capacity to produce sexual forms in various genetic backgrounds of the pea aphid with controlled symbiont composition and also in different aphid genotypes from natural populations with previously characterized infection status and reproductive mode. We found that most facultative symbionts exhibited detrimental effects on their hosts fitness under sex-inducing conditions in comparison with the reference lines. We also showed that the loss of sexual phase in permanently parthenogenetic lineages of A. pisum was not explained by facultative symbionts. Finally, we demonstrated that Spiroplasma infection annihilated the production of males in the host progeny by inducing a male-killing phenotype, an unexpected result for organisms such as aphids that reproduce primarily through clonal reproduction.},

We found that both species have recombination hotspots, which are enriched near functional genomic elements. Unlike in mice and apes, most hotspots are shared between the two species, and their conservation seems to extend over tens of millions of years. These observations suggest that in the absence of PRDM9, recombination targets functional features that both enable access to the genome and constrain its evolution.},

  abstract = {There is abundant geographic variation in both morphology and gene frequency in most species. The extent of geographic variation results from a balance of forces tending to produce local genetic differentiation and forces tending to produce genetic homogeneity. Mutation, genetic drift due to finite population size, and natural selection favoring adaptations to local environmental conditions will all lead to the genetic differentiation of local populations, and the movement of gametes, individuals, and even entire populations--collectively called gene flow--will oppose that differentiation. Gene flow may either constrain evolution by preventing adaptation to local conditions or promote evolution by spreading new genes and combinations of genes throughout a species' range. Several methods are available for estimating the amount of gene flow. Direct methods monitor ongoing gene flow, and indirect methods use spatial distributions of gene frequencies to infer past gene flow. Applications of these methods show that species differ widely in the gene flow that they experience. Of particular interest are those species for which direct methods indicate little current gene flow but indirect methods indicate much higher levels of gene flow in the recent past. Such species probably have undergone large-scale demographic changes relatively frequently.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination predominantly occurs at discrete genomic loci called recombination hotspots, but the features defining these areas are still largely unknown (reviewed in refs 1\textendash 5). To allow a comprehensive analysis of hotspot-associated DNA and chromatin characteristics, we developed a direct molecular approach for map- ping meiotic DNA double-strand breaks that initiate recombina- tion. Here we present the genome-wide distribution of recombination initiation sites in the mouse genome. Hotspot centres are mapped with approximately 200-nucleotide precision, which allows analysis of the fine structural details of the preferred recombination sites. We determine that hotspots share a centrally distributed consensus motif, possess a nucleotide skew that changes polarity at the centres of hot- spots and have an intrinsic preference to be occupied by a nucleo- some. Furthermore, we find that the vast majority of recombination initiation sites in mouse males are associated with testis-specific tri- methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 that is distinct from histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation marks associated with transcription. The recombination map presented here has been derived from a homo- geneous mouse population with a defined genetic background and therefore lends itself to extensive future experimental exploration. We note that the mapping technique developed here does not depend on the availability of genetic markers and hence can be easily adapted to other species with complex genomes. Our findings uncover several fundamental features of mammalian recombination hotspots and underline the power of the new recombination map for future studies of genetic recombination, genome stability and evolution.},

Red Phalaropes (Phalaropus fulicarius; herea(er ``phalaropes'') typically nest in grass\textendash sedge marshes, but nests have also been noted in rocky coastal habitats. We studied the reproductive ecology of phalaropes at East Bay, Southampton Island, Nunavut, to determine whether their use of coastal nest areas reflected a protective nesting association with an aggressive larid, the Sabine's Gull (Xema sabini; herea(er ``gull''). From 2000 to 2002, we found and monitored 29 phalarope nests with gull nests nearby ({$\leq$}150 m away) and 26 without gulls nearby. Coastal phalarope nests were nearer to gull nests than expected by chance. No habitat differences were detected between coastal areas with and without gull nests, but only three phalarope nests were found in coastal areas without gull nests. Thermistor probes inserted in phalarope nests revealed that incubators with gulls nearby behaved less cryptically, taking more frequent and longer incubation recesses. In human-approach experiments, phalaropes with gulls nearby flushed earlier than those without gulls. In 2000 and 2001, hatch success was 17\textendash 20\% higher for phalaropes with gulls nearby, but these nests had lower success rates than those without nearby gulls in 2002. These gulls are able to defend their nests from avian predators only; in 2002, arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus) were abundant, and their primary prey, collared lemmings (Dicrostonyx tor- quatus), were scarce. We suggest that phalaropes select coastal areas near gulls, but that this association is beneficial to phalaropes only in years when egg predation by arctic foxes is low.},

  abstract = {Facultative, heritable endosymbionts are found at intermediate prevalence within most insect species, playing frequent roles in their hosts' defence against environmental pressures. Focusing on Hamiltonella defensa, a common bacterial endosymbiont of aphids, we tested the hypothesis that such pressures impose seasonal balancing selection, shaping a widespread infection polymorphism. In our studied pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) population, Hamiltonella frequencies ranged from 23.2\% to 68.1\% across a six-month longitudinal survey. Rapid spikes and declines were often consistent across fields, and we estimated that selection coefficients for Hamiltonella-infected aphids changed sign within this field season. Prior laboratory research suggested antiparasitoid defence as the major Hamiltonella benefit, and costs under parasitoid absence. While a prior field study suggested these forces can sometimes act as counter-weights in a regime of seasonal balancing selection, our present survey showed no significant relationship between parasitoid wasps and Hamiltonella prevalence. Field cage experiments provided some explanation: parasitoids drove modest \textasciitilde 10\% boosts to Hamiltonella frequencies that would be hard to detect under less controlled conditions. They also showed that Hamiltonella was not always costly under parasitoid exclusion, contradicting another prediction. Instead, our longitudinal survey \textendash{} and two overwintering studies \textendash{} showed temperature to be the strongest predictor of Hamiltonella prevalence. Matching some prior lab discoveries, this suggested that thermally sensitive costs and benefits, unrelated to parasitism, can shape Hamiltonella dynamics. These results add to a growing body of evidence for rapid, seasonal adaptation in multivoltine organisms, suggesting that such adaptation can be mediated through the diverse impacts of heritable bacterial endosymbionts.},

A single colony of Polybia rejecta was found beside nests of Cacicus cela (Passeriformes: Icteridae). These associations appear to be related both to protection of the wasps nests by the ants and the protection of the ants nests by the wasps, as well as to protection of the bird nests by the wasps. The wasps take advantage of the tolerance of the ants, nesting near their colonies to obtain protection, so escaping attack by other ant species that feed on the immature wasps. Birds in turn take advantage of protection by these wasps against potential predators. This work adds new data to the study of associations of wasp species found in Central Brazilian Amazon, with descriptions of observed behaviors and photographs of such associations.},

  abstract = {We present an overlooked but important property of modern coexistence theory (MCT), along with two key new results and their consequences. The overlooked property is that stabilizing mechanisms (increasing species' niche differences) and equalizing mechanisms (re-ducing species' fitness differences) have two distinct sets of meanings within MCT: one in a two-species context and another in a general multispecies context. We demonstrate that the two-species framework is not a special case of the multispecies one, and therefore these two parallel frameworks must be studied independently. Our first result is that, using the two-species framework and mechanistic consumer-resource models, stabilizing and equalizing mechanisms exhibit complex interdependence, such that changing one will simultaneously change the other. Furthermore, the nature and direction of this simultaneous change sensitively depend on model parameters. The second result states that while MCT is often seen as bridging niche and neutral modes of coexistence by building a niche-neutrality continuum, the interdependence between stabilizing and equalizing mechanisms acts to break this continuum under almost any biologically relevant circumstance. We conclude that the complex entanglement of stabilizing and equalizing terms makes their impact on coexistence difficult to understand, but by seeing them as aggregated effects (rather than underlying causes) of coexistence, we may increase our understanding of ecological dynamics.},

The outcome of some priority effects may be more difficult to predict than others, but this possibility remains to be fully investigated. Here, we provide a graph-based, non-parametric, theoretical framework to understand the classification of priority effects and the predictability of multi-species communities. We show that we can classify priority effects by decomposing them into four basic dynamical sources: the number of alternative stable states, the number of alternative transient paths, the length of composition cycles, and the interaction between alternative stable states and composition cycles. Although the number of alternative stable states has received most of the attention, we show that the other three sources can contribute more to the predictability of community assembly, especially in small communities. We discuss how this theoretical framework can guide new experimental studies.},

Its sequence, protein structure, and function have been characterized in mammals, birds, and fish; however, a notable gap in our current knowledge of the function of IGF-1 and its molecular evolution is information in ectothermic reptiles. To address this disparity, we sequenced the coding region of IGF-1 in 11 reptile species-one crocodilian, three turtles, three lizards, and four snakes. Complete sequencing of the full mRNA transcript of a snake revealed the Ea-isoform, the predominant isoform of IGF-1 also reported in other vertebrate groups. A gene tree of the IGF-1 protein-coding region that incorporated sequences from diverse vertebrate groups showed similarity to the species phylogeny, with the exception of the placement of Testudines as sister group to Aves, due to their high nucleotide sequence similarity. In contrast, long-branch lengths indicate more rapid divergence in IGF-1 among lizards and snakes. Additionally, lepidosaurs (i.e., lizards and snakes) had higher rates of non-synonymous:synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) relative to archosaurs (i.e., birds and crocodilians) and turtles. Tests for positive selection on specific codons within branches and evaluation of the changes in the amino acid properties, suggested positive selection in lepidosaurs on the C domain of IGF-1, which is involved in binding affinity to the IGF-1 receptor. Predicted structural changes suggest that major alterations in protein structure and function may have occurred in reptiles. These data propose new insights into the molecular co-evolution of IGF-1 and its receptors, and ultimately the evolution of IGF-1's role in regulating life-history traits across vertebrates.},

Two sides of the climate space are set by physical characteristics of the environment. The upper and lower limits of the climate space are determined by the size of the alligator, its insulation, metabolic and evaporative water loss rates, heat conducted to the ground, and its maximum and minimum sustainable body temperatures. When the alligator is at its preferred body temperature it is restricted to a small portion of its climate space. This may result in a competitive disadvantage with homeotherms that can maintain a constant internal temperature over a wide range of environmental conditions. Small alligators are more affected by wind speed than large individuals but can tolerate higher temperatures when exposed to full sunlight. Large alligators can operate outside their climate space because they can store large amounts of heat which they dump when they return within their steady-state regimes. Small individuals are closely tied to the limits of their climate space because of their small heat-storage capacity. All sizes of alligators can withstand a wide range of temperatures in a blackbody cavity. Water is the most important part of an alligator's habitat because it acts as a substitute for blackbody conditions and insures maximum utilization of an alligator's potential climate space.If alligators are deprived of water their activity is greatly restricted and their chance of survival is greatly reduced.},

  abstract = {A mathematical model for heat conduction through large reptiles is developed. The animal is approximated by a large cylinder with a central core of tissue kept at a uniform temperature by blood flow, surrounded by six layers of fat. An iterative mathematical procedure is used to solve equations for heat flowing into, heat flowing out of, and heat stored in each layer and the core during a specified time period. This yields the temperatures of the core and insulating layers at the end of the time period. Physiological and environmental parameters are incremented and calculations repeated for a new time period. These calculations show that a large reptile (D = 100 cm) would have a relatively constant high body temperature when exposed to warm, diurnally fluctuating environmental conditions, even with a low metabolic rate, as long as the average values of the physical parameters result in a body temperature within tolerable limits. Changes in fat thickness are of minor importance in determining the constancy of body temperature. If exposed to excessively hot or cold climates, large reptiles would have a constant excessively high or low body temperature. A time-constant equation is developed to describe the effect of size on the response of body temperature to environmental heat loads in small and large reptiles. Gigantism would be a very useful strategy for reptiles, providing a constant, equable internal temperature in a stable, warm climate. This strategy may have been selected for in dinosaurs, giving them a high stable body temperature without a high metabolic rate. Our calculations support the hypothesis that thermal stress resulting from decreased equability of climate may have been a primary factor in the extinction of dinosaurs during the late Cretaceous.},

This can result in multiple strains of host specialists coexisting within a single parasitic species. A long-standing conundrum is how such sympatric host races can be maintained within a single parasitic species in the face of interbreeding among conspecifics specializing on different hosts. Striking examples are seen in certain avian brood parasites such as cuckoos, many of which show host-specific differentiation in traits such as host egg mimicry. Exploiting a Zambian egg collection amassed over several decades and supplemented by recent fieldwork, we show that the brood parasitic Greater Honeyguide \emph{Indicator indicator} exhibits host-specific differentiation in both egg size and egg shape. Genetic analysis of honeyguide eggs and chicks show that two highly divergent mitochondrial DNA lineages are associated with ground- and tree-nesting hosts, respectively, indicating perfect fidelity to two mutually exclusive sets of host species for millions of years. Despite their age and apparent adaptive diversification, however, these ancient lineages are not cryptic species; a complete lack of differentiation in nuclear genes shows that mating between individuals reared by different hosts is sufficiently frequent to prevent speciation. These results indicate that host specificity is maternally inherited, that host-specific adaptation among conspecifics can be maintained without reproductive isolation, and that host specificity can be remarkably ancient in evolutionary terms.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Here, we explore how priority effects might influence microbial communities in the gastrointestinal tract during early childhood and how the strength of priority effects can be estimated from the composition of the microbial species pool. We also discuss factors that alter microbial transmission, such as delivery mode, diet and parenting behaviours such as breastfeeding, which can influence the likelihood of priority effects.

Pathogen-mediated selection (PMS) is believed to generate the extraordinary levels of MHC diversity observed. However, establishing the relative importance of the three proposed mechanisms of PMS (heterozygote advantage, rare-allele advantage and fluctuating selection) has proved extremely difficult. Studies have attempted to differentiate between mechanisms of PMS using two approaches: (i) comparing MHC diversity with that expected under neutrality and (ii) relating MHC diversity to pathogen regime. Here, we show that in many cases the same predictions arise from the different mechanisms under these approaches, and that most studies that have inferred one mechanism of selection have not fully considered the alternative explanations. We argue that, while it may be possible to demonstrate that particular mechanisms of PMS are occurring, resolving their relative importance within a system is probably impossible. A more realistic target is to continue to demonstrate when and where the different mechanisms of PMS occur, with the aim of determining their relative importance across systems. We put forward what we believe to be the most promising approaches that will allow us to progress towards achieving this.},

Two kinds of flock participants are recognized: those that join other species ('followers') and are therefore likely to be the recipients of the benefits of flock participation and those that are joined ('leaders'). Through comparative analyses, using a large sample of flocks from around the world, we show that (1) 'followers' tend to be smaller, more insectivorous, and feed in higher strata than matched species that participate in flocks to a lesser extent and (2) 'leaders' tend to be cooperative breeders more often than matched species that are not known to lead flocks. Furthermore, meta-analyses of published results from across the world showed that bird species in terrestrial mixed-species flocks increase foraging rates and reduce vigilance compared to when they are solitary or in conspecific groups. Moreover, the increase in foraging rates is seen only with flock followers and not flock leaders. These findings suggest a role for predation in the evolution of mixed-species flocking. Species that are vulnerable to predation follow species whose vigilance they can exploit. By doing so, they are able to reduce their own vigilance and forage at higher rates.},

Indeed, proportions of fitness space that successfully maintain polymorphism are substantially larger in spatially heterogenous populations with lower to moderate levels of gene flow when compared to single-deme models. Nevertheless, the effect of spatial heterogeneity on the evolutionary construction of polymorphism is less clear. We have investigated the levels of polymorphism resulting from a simple two-deme construction model, which incorporates recurrent mutation as well as selection. We further compared fitness properties, stability of equilibria, and frequency distribution patterns emerging from the construction approach and compared these to the static fitness-space approach. The construction model either promotes or constrains the level of polymorphisms, depending on the levels of gene flow. Comparison of the fitness properties resulting from both approaches shows that they maintain variation in different parts of fitness space. The part of fitness space resulting from construction is more stable than that implied by the ahistoric fitness-space approach. Finally, the equilibrium allele-frequency distribution patterns vary substantially with different levels of gene flow, underlining the importance of correctly sampling spatial structure if these patterns are to be used to estimate population-genetic processes.},

Over a 12-wk period, alligators fed diets containing 2.5 or 5.0\% chicken liver oil grew longer and heavier and converted feed to body mass more efficiently than alligators fed other fat/oil combi nations that lacked or contained only trace amounts of arac hidonic acid [20:4( n-6)]. Alligators fed an EFA- deficient diet (containing only coconut fat as the di etary fat) were the slowest-growing animals and converted feed to body mass least efficiently. However, over a 41-wk feeding period, alligators fed this diet showed no obvious external signs of deficiency other than being reduced in size and unthrifty. Fatty acid composition of heart, liver, muscle, skin and adipose tissue lipids was influenced markedly by dietary fat composition. Tissues varied significantly in response to dietary fat composition. Heart lipids contained the lowest levels of short- and medium-chain fatty acids and the highest levels of arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid levels were less influenced by diet than were levels of other 20- and 22-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids. Radiotracer studies indicated that linoleic acid was converted to arachidonic acid in the liver. Never theless, tissue arachidonic acid levels also appeared to be maintained by concentration from dietary sources and selective conservation. It appears that a dietary source of arachidonic acid may be required for a maximum rate of growth.},

Dilution of a high-protein, low-fat, carbohydrate-free diet with graded levels of fat (3.6-16.6\% dietary dry matter) resulted in significantly greater body weight gains and improved feed conversion. Percent carcass fat was greater with increased dietary fat. Digestibility of protein (87.3-89.2\%) and energy (84.6-86.8\%) decreased slightly with increases in caloric density of the diet. Digestible energy (DE) and a nitrogen-corrected digestible energy (DE,) increased with dietary gross energy. A second experiment compared two high-protein diets (meat and a purified diet) and the effects of supplementing these diets with glucose or extruded corn as 20\% of dietary dry matter. The purified diet led to greater gains in body weight than the meat diet. Supplementation with corn did not significantly influence performance. Glucose supplementation of meat significantly im- proved body weight gains, but similar supplementation of the purified diet decreased performance. In a third experiment, alligators fed a carbohydrate-containing diet consumed significantly more feed and gained significantly more weight than those fed diets with protein as the corresponding energy source. Digestibility of protein, approximately 40\% of which was isolated soybean protein, was very high (96.0-97.1\%). Variation in energy digestibility (78.5-91.3Oh) was related to dietary fiber con- tent. Liver lipogenesis from acetate was generally greater than from leucine and glucose. However, for alligators fed the carbohydrate-containing diet, liver lipogenesis from glucose and acetate was not significantly different. In several experiments, carcass and adipose tissue fatty acids were generally reflective of dietary treatment. However, steak acid levels were low and unaffected by diet.},

Response surface analysis predicted maximum responses in performance criteria at 6.3-18.8\% corn and 15.8-27.4\% fat. Corn inclusion at up to 27-36\% of diet resulted in equal or improved performance compared to carbohydrate-free diets of equal fat content. Energy digestibility averaged 84.3\%.

In two additional experiments, alligators were either fasted or fed for various numbers of days/week. Carbohydrate-supplementation of high protein diets led to equal or significantly improved performances. Performance was maximized by feeding the alligators 5-6 d/w. Regression of body weight changes against energy and protein intake yielded estimates of daily maintenance requirements of 5.7-8.4 kcal and 0.49-0.89 g protein/kg live body weight. Dietary fat and carbohydrate in the forms and amounts fed to young alligators were well-utilized.

A possible mechanism for achieving this balance is for individuals to modulate the physical properties of their signals or to alter the proportion of time spent signaling, depending upon local levels of predation pressure. We test the hypothesis that prey can alter their visual signaling behavior to decrease conspicuousness and potentially limit predation risk via modulation of signal properties or display rate. To do so, we conducted a manipulative experiment in nature to evaluate the possible effect of predation pressure on the physical properties of movement-based signals and on the proportion of time spent signaling by using a well-understood predator-prey system in the Bahamas, the semiarboreal lizard Anolis sagrei, and one of its main predators, the curly-tailed lizard Leiocephalus carinatus. We find that on islands onto which the predator was introduced, male anoles reduce the maximum amplitude of head-bob displays but not the proportion of time spent signaling, in comparison with control islands lacking the predator. This reduction of amplitude also decreases signal active space, which might alter the reproductive success of signaling individuals. We suggest that future studies of predator-prey interactions consider the risk effects generated by changes in signals or signaling behavior to fully determine the influence of predation pressure on the dynamics of prey populations.},

The main conclusion is that an ecosystem in a physically constant environment may be in one of two evolutionary modes: (i) Red Queen, or steady state of evolutionary change, or (ii) evolutionary stasis. In the latter case, continued evolution necessarily depends on changes in the physical environment. A decision as to which mode has been prevalent in the past will depend on a study of the fossil record. However, it is pointed out that such study of the past necessarily must be accompanied by the study of how organisms interact in current ecosystems.},

However, fundamental mechanisms remain poorly understood regarding factors that enable certain populations, such as biological invaders, to rapidly transition to novel habitats. According to one hypothesis, environmental fluctuations in the native range could promote successful invasions by imposing balancing selection on key traits and maintaining the genetic variation that enables rapid adaptation in novel habitats. Here we test the genomic predictions of this hypothesis by performing whole-genome sequencing of multiple independent invasive freshwater and native saline populations of the copepod Eurytemora affinis complex. We found that invasive populations have repeatedly responded to selection through the parallel use of the same single-nucleotide polymorphisms and genomic loci, to a much greater degree than expected. These same loci were enriched for signatures of long-term balancing selection in the native ranges, with 15\textendash 47\% of loci exhibiting significant signatures of balancing selection. The strong association between parallel evolution in the invaded range and balancing selection in the native range supports the hypothesis that fluctuating habitats can promote invasive success and that balancing selection might serve as a widespread and important mechanism that enables rapid adaptation in nature.},

These metrics originated to quantify aspects of human health, but have also proven useful to address questions in life history, ecology and resource management of game and commercial animals. We review the application of condition indices (CI) for conservation studies and focus on measures that quantify fat reserves, known to be critical for energetically challenging activities such as migration, reproduction and survival during periods of scarcity. Standard methods score fat content, or rely on a ratio of body mass rationalized by some measure of size, usually a linear dimension such as wing length or total body length. Higher numerical values of these indices are interpreted to mean an animal has greater energy reserves. Such CIs can provide predictive information about habitat quality and reproductive output, which in turn can help managers with conservation assessments and policies. We review the issues about the methods and metrics of measurement and describe the linkage of CIs to measures of body shape. Debates in the literature about the best statistical methods to use in computing and comparing CIs remain unresolved. Next, we comment on the diversity of methods used to measure body composition and the diversity of physiological models that compute body composition and CIs. The underlying physiological regulatory systems that govern the allocation of energy and nutrients among compartments and processes within the body are poorly understood, especially for field situations, and await basic data from additional laboratory studies and advanced measurement systems including telemetry. For now, standard physiological CIs can provide supporting evidence and mechanistic linkages for population studies that have traditionally been the focus of conservation biology. Physiologists can provide guidance for the field application of conditions indices with validation studies and development of new instruments.},

  abstract = {Recent work has revealed a new class of "zero-determinant" (ZD) strategies for iterated, two-player games. ZD strategies allow a player to unilaterally enforce a linear relationship between her score and her opponent's score, and thus to achieve an unusual degree of control over both players' long-term payoffs. Although originally conceived in the context of classical two-player game theory, ZD strategies also have consequences in evolving populations of players. Here, we explore the evolutionary prospects for ZD strategies in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD). Several recent studies have focused on the evolution of "extortion strategies," a subset of ZD strategies, and have found them to be unsuccessful in populations. Nevertheless, we identify a different subset of ZD strategies, called "generous ZD strategies," that forgive defecting opponents but nonetheless dominate in evolving populations. For all but the smallest population sizes, generous ZD strategies are not only robust to being replaced by other strategies but can selectively replace any noncooperative ZD strategy. Generous strategies can be generalized beyond the space of ZD strategies, and they remain robust to invasion. When evolution occurs on the full set of all IPD strategies, selection disproportionately favors these generous strategies. In some regimes, generous strategies outperform even the most successful of the well-known IPD strategies, including win-stay-lose-shift.},

The model is developed from the stochastic spatially explicit Heliothis virescens model described by Peck et al. (1999), to accommodate a spatial mix of two host crops (corn and cotton), and to re\ss ect the agronomic practices, as well as the spatial and temporal population dynamics of H. zea, in eastern North Carolina. The model suggests that selection for resistance is more intense in Bt cotton \TH elds than in Bt corn \TH elds. It further suggests that local gene frequencies are highly dependent on local deployment levels of Bt crops despite the high mobility of the adult insects. Region-wide average gene frequencies depend on the region-wide level of Bt deployment, so incomplete technology adoption slows the rate of resistance evolution. However, on a local scale, H. zea populations in clusters of \TH elds in which Bt use is high undergo far more rapid evolution than populations in neighboring clusters of \TH elds in which Bt use is low. The model suggests that farm-level refuge requirements are important for managing the risk of resistance. The model can be used as an aid in designing plans for monitoring for resistance by suggesting the appropriate distribution of monitoring locations, which should focus on areas of highest Bt crop deployment. The \TH ndings need to be placed in the context of the input parameters, many of which are uncertain or highly variable in nature, and therefore, a thorough sensitivity analysis is warranted.},

These detrimental nontarget effects motivate the use of alternative pest management strategies such as host plant resistance and intercropping. However, when alternative pest management strategies effectively suppress primary pests, they also have the potential to promote secondary pest populations via competitive release. The potato leafhopper (Empoasca fabae) is a key pest of alfalfa, and leafhopper-resistant cultivars are being widely adopted by growers in the Midwest and Northeast United States. We conducted a field experiment comparing leafhopper-susceptible alfalfa, leafhopper-resistant alfalfa, and leafhopper-resistant alfalfa intercropped with orchardgrass. Leafhopper-resistant alfalfa reduced potato leafhopper abundance and protected the crop from protein loss, but there was no benefit of intercropping leafhopper-resistant alfalfa with orchardgrass. Importantly, the abundance of a secondary pest, the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), was twice as high in the leafhopper-resistant plant treatments compared to the leafhopper-susceptible treatment. Field sampling and microcosm experiments confirmed that the increase in pea aphids was caused, at least in part, by release from competition with leafhoppers. These results suggest that, when host plant resistance against insects is employed, efforts to monitor and manage secondary pest populations are warranted.},

Recently, we have seen a growing appreciation of how multispecies interactions can act synergistically or antagonistically to alter the ecological and evolutionary outcomes of interactions in ways that differ fundamentally from outcomes predicted by pairwise interactions. Here, we review the evidence for criteria identified to detect community-based, diffuse coevolution. These criteria include (a) the presence of genetic correlations between traits involved in multiple interactions, (b) interactions with one species that alter the likelihood or intensity of interactions with other species, and (c) nonadditive combined effects of multiple interactors. In addition, we review the evidence that multispecies interactions have demographic consequences for populations, as well as evolutionary consequences. Finally, we explore the experimental and analytical techniques, and their limitations, used in the study of multispecies interactions. Throughout, we discuss areas in particular need of future research.},

In 1977 larvae and emerging adults were collected, whilst in 1978 only adults were sampled. Benthic sampling showed the larval communities to be predominated by Chironomus spp. whilst trapping of adults showed that this group accounted for only 4\% of the emergence. This difference is attributed to the selective retention of the larger Chironomus larvae by the sieve used to screen benthos samples. The pioneer chironomid communities in the ponds are compared using similarity and diversity indices on adult emergence data. These showed that the pond communities were remarkably uniform in 1977, the first year of their existence, due to the predominance of Tanytarsus gracilentus. In 1978 the communities were much more variable. The community structure changed within the two years, with equitability increasing rapidly to that characteristic of a much more mature habitat. These successional changes are attributed to a reduction in uniformity of the habitat resulting from the growth of aquatic macrophytes. \textcopyright{} 1979, Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.

One has focused on phylogenetic analyses that treat social traits as static, species-specific characteristics; the other has focused on understanding the behavioral flexibility of particular populations or species in response to local ecological or demographic variables. Here, we combine these approaches by distinguishing between constraining traits such as dispersal regimes (male, female, or bi-sexual), which are relatively invariant, and responding traits such as grouping patterns (stable, fission-fusion, sometimes fission-fusion), which can reflect rapid adjustments to current conditions. Using long-term and cross-sectional data from 29 studies of 22 species of wild primates, we confirm that dispersal regime exhibits a strong phylogenetic signal in our sample. We then show that primate species with high variation in group size and adult sex ratios exhibit variability in grouping pattern (i.e., sometimes fission-fusion) with dispersal regime constraining the grouping response. When assessing demographic variation, we found a strong positive relationship between the variability in group size over time and the number of observation years, which further illustrates the importance of long-term demographic data to interpretations of social behavior. Our approach complements other comparative efforts to understand the role of behavioral flexibility by distinguishing between constraining and responding traits, and incorporating these distinctions into analyses of social states over evolutionary and ecological time.},

On small islands in Florida, we found that the lizard Anolis carolinensis moved to higher perches following invasion by Anolis sagrei and, in response, adaptively evolved larger toepads after only 20 generations.

Here, I describe results from a manipulative study showing that an orb-weaver spider, Eustala oblonga, inhabits an ant-acacia for protection from predators. This spider is unique in the orb- weaver family in that it associates closely with both a specific host plant and ants. I tested the protective effect of acacia ants on E. oblonga by comparing spider abundance over time on acacias with ants and on acacias from which entire ant colonies were experimentally removed. Both juvenile and adult spider abundance significantly decreased over time on acacias without ants. Concomi- tantly, the combined abundance of potential spider predators increased over time on acacias without ants. These results suggest that ant protection of the ant-acacia Acacia melanocerus also protects the spiders, thus supporting the hypothesis that E. oblonga exploits the ant\textendash acacia mutualism for enemy-free space. Although E. oblonga takes advantage of the protection services of ants, it likely exacts little to no cost and should not threaten the stability of the ant\textendash{} acacia mutualism. Indeed, the potential threat of exploiter species to protection mutualisms in general may be limited to species that exploit the material rewards traded in such mutualisms rather than the protection services.},

We experimentally created large and small groups along the gradient and manipulated interspecific competition with flies by heating carcasses. We show that cooperative groups performed as thermal generalists with similarly high breeding success at all temperatures and elevations, whereas non-cooperative groups performed as thermal specialists with higher breeding success only at intermediate temperatures and elevations.

Using a stage-structured consumer-resource model in which juvenile development and maturation are resource dependent, we study how a species' reproductive schedule evolves, dependent on the seasonal-ity of its resource. We find three qualitatively different reproduction modes. First, continuous income breeding (with adults reproducing throughout the year) evolves in the absence of significant seasonal-ity. Second, seasonal income breeding (with adults reproducing unless they are starving) evolves when resource availability is sufficiently seasonal and juveniles are more efficient resource foragers. Third, seasonal capital breeding (with adults reproducing partly through the use of energy reserves) evolves when resource availability is sufficiently seasonal and adults are more efficient resource foragers. Such capital breeders start reproduction already while their offspring are still experiencing starvation. Changes in season-ality lead to continuous transitions between continuous and seasonal income breeding, but the change between income and capital breeding involves a hysteresis pattern, such that a population's evo-lutionarily stable reproduction pattern depends on its initial one. Taken together, our findings show how adaptation to seasonal environments can result in a rich array of outcomes, exhibiting seasonal or continuous reproduction with or without energy reserves.},

  abstract = {Chironomidae species are universally used for studying the impact of pollutants in aquatic systems. The nonbiting midge Propsilocerus akamusi is often found in urban streams and is suitable for use as a toxicological bioindicator. However, few studies have previously examined metal stress in this species. We sequenced the genome of this urban midge to address this question. Here, we present the first chromosome-\- level genome of P. akamusi, obtained from Illumina short-\-read and PacBio long-\-read sequences with Hi-\-C technology. The size of the very small assembled genome was 85.83 Mb with a contig N50 of 6.2 Mb and a scaffold N50 of 26.1 Mb. This assembly revealed significant expansion of haemoglobin (Hb) genes, some of which formed large tandem repeats. Transcriptomic studies for copper tolerance identified four genes in the tandem array that were highly expressed, all of which presented intron loss. This characteristic might highlight the potential role of Hb genes in copper tolerance. Additionally, detoxification genes, chemosensory genes and heat shock protein genes of this midge were identified, some of which are associated with metal stress. The high-\-quality assembled genome of P. akamusi and the transcriptomic analyses provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of heavy metal stress. Our comparison of the P. akamusi genome with other dipteran genomes provides valuable resources for understanding the evolutionary history, genetics, and ecology of this species as well as those of other midges.},

Females of the pink strain produced many more alate offspring in response to this stimulus than did the green forms. The proportion of alatae in the progenies of crowded females of both strains was dependent upon both the duration of the treatment and the density of the aphids when crowded. Whereas two individuals of the pink strain when confined together for 24 hr induced a strong response in each other, aphids of the green strain produced few alatae unless confined in groups of 10. Control aphids starved for 24 hr in isolation gave no response. However, winged forms occasionally appeared, apparently randomly, in the offspring of unstarved but isolated pink females. Similar females of the green strain produced only apterous daughters. Larvae of both strains are irrevocably determined as alatae or apterae before their birth. No post-natal response to tactile stimulation or any other environmental factor could be demonstrated. Determination probably takes place shortly prior to birth.},

  abstract = {Theoretical and empirical studies are showing evidence in support of evolutionary branching and sympatric speciation due to frequency-dependent competition. However, phenotypic diversification due to underlying genetic diversification is only one possible evolutionary response to disruptive selection. Another potentially general response is phenotypic diversification in the form of phenotypic plasticity. It has been suggested that genetic variation is favored in stable environments, whereas phenotypic plasticity is favored in unstable and fluctuating environments. We investigate the "competition" between the processes of evolutionary branching and the evolution of phenotypic plasticity in a predator-prey model that allows both processes to occur. In this model, environmental fluctuations can be caused by complicated population dynamics. We found that the evolution of phenotypic plasticity was generally more likely than evolutionary branching when the ecological dynamics exhibited pronounced predator-prey cycles, whereas the opposite was true when the ecological dynamics was more stable. At intermediate levels of density cycling, trimorphisms with two specialist branches and a phenotypically plastic generalist branch sometimes occurred. Our theoretical results suggest that ecological dynamics and evolutionary dynamics can often be tightly linked and that an explicit consideration of population dynamics may be essential to explain the evolutionary dynamics of diversification in natural populations.},

An explanation for this pattern is that density fluctuations may influence selective regime forms in populations. Still, only few studies have investigated evolutionary dynamics in fluctuating populations. Here we report on a multiyear study of the Eurasian perch, wherein the fitness landscape shifts between stabilizing and directional selection at low density to disruptive selection at high density. Intrinsically driven population fluctuations is the mechanism that most likely explains these shifts in fitness landscape. Stable isotope data showed that the habitat choices of perch were stable over the growing season, indicating that the selection pressure observed each year influenced the fitness of perch in the following year's reproductive period. Furthermore, the morphological differences between perch caught in the two habitats (littoral and pelagic) were more pronounced at high density than at low density. This study shows that an explicit consideration of population dynamics may be essential to explain the long-term evolutionary dynamics in populations. In particular, fluctuating population dynamics may be one explanation for why not all polymorphic populations lead to speciation. Instead, fluctuating population dynamics may favor the evolution of phenotypic plasticity.},

The first approach is independent of any specific ecological model and based on curvature properties of the fitness landscape as a function of the dimension of the trait space. This approach indeed suggests a positive correlation between complexity and diversity. An assumption made in this first approach is that the potential for any pair of traits to interact in their effect on fitness is independent of the dimension of the trait space. In the second approach, we circumvent making this assumption by analyzing the evolutionary dynamics in an explicit consumer-resource model in which the shape of the fitness landscape emerges from the underlying mechanistic ecological model. In this model, consumers are characterized by several quantitative traits and feed on a multidimensional resource distribution. The consumer's feeding efficiency on the resource is determined by the match between consumer phenotype and resource item. This analysis supports a positive correlation between the complexity of the evolving consumer species and its potential to diversify with the additional insight that also increasing resource complexity facilitates diversification.},

When red pea aphids feed on low quality plants in crowded conditions, some individuals lose their color shade and become pale yellowish, while other individuals on the same host plants remain changeless. The pale aphids have been shown to walk significantly faster and migrate more frequently to neighboring plants compared to the original red ones. We hypothesized that the color change and higher activity of pale aphids are directly associated with their suboptimal nutritional status. We showed that the pale aphids have significantly lower wet and dry weights than red ones. Analyses of energy reserves in individual aphids revealed that the pale aphids suffer a significant loss in their lipid and soluble carbohydrate contents. Our results provide a strong link between host quality, body color, dispersal rate, and energy reserves of pea aphids. Apparently, utilization of energy reserves resulted from an imbalance in food sources received by the aphids stimulates them to walk more actively to find new hosts and restore their lost energy. This reversible shift enables aphids to quickly respond to deprived host plants much earlier than the appearance of winged morph and restore their original status when they find appropriate host.},

  abstract = {CpG islands are useful markers for genes in organisms containing 5-methylcytosine in their genomes. In addition, CpG islands located in the promoter regions of genes can play important roles in gene silencing during processes such as X-chromosome inactivation, imprinting, and silencing of intragenomic parasites. The generally accepted definition of what constitutes a CpG island was proposed in 1987 by Gardiner-Garden and Frommer [Gardiner-Garden, M. \& Frommer, M. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196, 261-282] as being a 200-bp stretch of DNA with a C+G content of 50\% and an observed CpG/expected CpG in excess of 0.6. Any definition of a CpG island is somewhat arbitrary, and this one, which was derived before the sequencing of mammalian genomes, will include many sequences that are not necessarily associated with controlling regions of genes but rather are associated with intragenomic parasites. We have therefore used the complete genomic sequences of human chromosomes 21 and 22 to examine the properties of CpG islands in different sequence classes by using a search algorithm that we have developed. Regions of DNA of greater than 500 bp with a G+C equal to or greater than 55\% and observed CpG/expected CpG of 0.65 were more likely to be associated with the 5' regions of genes and this definition excluded most Alu-repetitive elements. We also used genome sequences to show strong CpG suppression in the human genome and slight suppression in Drosophila melanogaster and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This finding is compatible with the recent detection of 5-methylcytosine in Drosophila, and might suggest that S. cerevisiae has, or once had, CpG methylation.},

As competition tends to be stronger between species with more similar niches, we hypothesize that species phylogenetic relatedness, under niche conservatism, may be a reasonable surrogate of niche similarity between species, and thus influence the strength of priority effects. We tested this hypothesis using a laboratory microcosm experiment in which we established bacterial species pools with different levels of phylogenetic relatedness and manipulated the immigration history of species from each pool into microcosms. Our results showed that strong priority effects, and hence multiple community states, only emerged for the species pool with the greatest phylogenetic relatedness. Community assembly also resulted in a significant positive relationship between bacterial phylogenetic diversity and ecosystem functions. Interestingly, these results emerged despite a lack of phylogenetic conservatism for most of the bacterial functional traits considered. Our results highlight the utility of phylogenetic information for understanding the structure and functioning of ecological communities, even when phylogenetically conserved functional traits are not identified or measured. \textcopyright{} 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

The first model is identical to that of Slatkin (1980) but we extend his analysis. The second model allows for the evolution of all niche attributes that affect interspecific competition along a resource axis. These are: the mean position of each species along the axis, the variation in position between phenotypes within each species, and the width of resources used by each phenotype. In addition, explicit dynamics for the resources are included in the model. This model predicts that character displacement can occur in coevolutionary communities. It also predicts that the relative niche separations between species (d/w ratios; d = distance between peaks of two species' niches on the resource (niche) axis, w = total niche width of a species) can be quite large, that the d/w values should decrease as species number increases, that at the evolutionary equilibrium, the within-individual component of the niche width will be much larger than the betweenindividual component, and that niche separation should be substantially smaller than character separation. These predictions are all in agreement with field observations surveyed from the literature.

  abstract = {For modeling charcter displacement three competing methods (the coevolutionarily stable community (CSC), the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), and quantitative genetic recursion (QGR) are here compared in models using a common ecological setting. Specific predictions of CSC model have been used to understand features of character displacement among Cnemidophorus lizards on islands off Mexico, Anolis lizards in the Lesser Antilles and Galapagos finches. Conceptually the three formalisms vary in the degree to which within species variability is allowed in the models. The predictions of the CSC are found not to be robust to even small violation of its fundamental assumption of absolute species monomorphy. Simulation and analytical observations show that the CSC is not valid under frequency dependent selection, and that the ESS is the limiting case of QGR as intraspecific phenotypic variation goes to zero. Thus the ESS and the QGR models agree closely when the between-phenotype component (BPC) of the niche width is small. However, as the BPC increases, quantitative discrepancies between ESS and QGR predictions increase, although model behavior remains qualitatively similar. A fourth approach, termed "Quantitative Genetic Optimization' analysis, is suggested, combining advantages of both the ESS and QGR. Although all approaches support the possibility of taxon cycles, the cycle patterns predicted are qualitatively different and strongly model dependent. -from Authors},

The various approaches to this question have fallen into one of the following categories: the fixation probability of a mutant allele in a wild type population, some measures of gene frequency and gene frequency change, and a formulation of the inclusive fitness effect. Countless theoretical studies have examined the relationship between these approaches, and it has generally been thought that, under standard simplifying assumptions, they yield equivalent results. Most of this theoretical work, however, has assumed homogeneity of the population interaction structure\textemdash that is, that all individuals are equivalent. We explore the question of selective advantage in a general (heterogeneous) population and show that, although appropriate measures of fixation probability and gene frequency change are equivalent, they are not, in general, equivalent to the inclusive fitness effect.

It may be, however, that both factors act together to promote evolutionary divergence, although there are few examples of such interaction in nature. We tested phylogenetic predictions of an explicit historical model of divergence (double invasions of freshwater by marine ancestors) in sympatric species of three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) where determinism has been implicated as an important factor driving evolutionary novelty. Microsatellite DNA variation at six loci revealed relatively low genetic variation in freshwater populations, supporting the hypothesis that they were derived by colonization of freshwater by more diverse marine ancestors. Phylogenetic and genetic distance analyses suggested that pairs of sympatric species have evolved multiple times, further implicating determinism as a factor in speciation. Our data also supported predictions based on the hypothesis that the evolution of sympatric species was contingent upon 'double invasions' of postglacial lakes by ancestral marine sticklebacks. Sympatric sticklebacks, therefore, provide an example of adaptive radiation by determinism contingent upon historical conditions promoting unique ecological interactions, and illustrate how contingency and determinism may interact to generate geographical variation in species diversity},

However, the number of mutations needed to evolve a key innovation is rarely known, or whether other sets of mutations would also suffice, whether the intermediate steps are driven by natural selection, or how contingent the outcome is on steps along the way. Meyer et al. (p. [428][1]; see the Perspective by [Thompson][2] ) answer these questions for a case in which phage lambda evolved the ability to infect its host Escherichia coli through a novel receptor. This shift required four mutations, which accumulated under natural selection in concert with coevolution of the host. However, when Tenaillon et al. (p. [457][3]) exposed 115 lines of E. coli to high temperature and sequenced them, adaptation occurred through many different genetic paths, showing parallelism at the level of genes and interacting protein complexes, but only rarely at the nucleotide level.

Ecologists' interest in transient dynamics is growing because populations regularly deviate from the stable stage distribution, which can lead to transient dynamics that differ significantly from the stable stage dynamics. Because the structure of a population matrix (i.e., the number of life-history stages) can influence the predicted scale of the deviation, we explored the effect of matrix size on predicted transient dynamics and the resulting amplification of population size. First, we experimentally measured the transition rates between the different life-history stages and the adult fecundity and survival of the aphid, Acythosiphon pisum. Second, we used these data to parameterize models with different numbers of stages. Third, we compared model predictions with empirically measured transient population growth following the introduction of a single adult aphid. We find that the models with the largest number of life-history stages predicted the largest transient population growth rates, but in all models there was a considerable discrepancy between predicted and empirically measured transient peaks and a dramatic underestimation of final population sizes. For instance, the mean population size after 20 days was 2394 aphids compared to the highest predicted population size of 531 aphids; the predicted asymptotic growth rate ({$\lambda$}max) was consistent with the experiments. Possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed. \textcopyright{} 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Does evolution in a community context affect functional group diversity? Mathematical methods: We simulated the population dynamics and evolution of multiple species competing for discrete, substitutable resources. Key assumptions: Species' competitive effect and response are based on resource-use overlap. Evolution occurs via selection on mutations of small effect. Intraspecific genetic variation is the same for each species. Predictions: Evolution of equivalence is possible when species evolve in a community context. A combination of convergence, divergence, and extinctions occurs when the number of species exceeds the number of resources. Species avoid competitive exclusion via convergence or divergence in their resource use. Ecological and evolutionary outcomes depend on an interaction between the rate of evolution and the initial similarity of competitors. The evolution of equivalence determines diversity within functional groups, but niche processes drive diversity among groups. \textcopyright{} 2010 Casey P. terHorst.},

Consequently, predicting trait evolution in natural communities may require understanding ecological and evolutionary dynamics involving a number of species. In August 2016, the American Society of Naturalists sponsored a symposium to explore evolution in a community context, focusing on microevolutionary processes. Here we provide an introduction to our perspectives on this topic by defining the context and describing some examples of when and how microevolutionary responses to multiple species may differ from evolution in isolation or in two-species communities. We find that indirect ecological and evolutionary effects can result in nonadditive selection and evolution that cannot be predicted from pairwise interactions. Genetic correlations of ecological traits in one species can alter trait evolution and adaptation as well as the abundances of other species. In general, evolution in multispecies communities can change ecological interactions, which then feed back to future evolutionary changes in ways that depend on these indirect effects. We suggest avenues for future research in this field, including determining the circumstances under which pairwise evolution does not adequately describe evolutionary trajectories.},

In vertebrates, a limited number of studies have specifically assessed the temporal stability of population structure for more than one generation. In this study, we performed a microsatellite analysis of DNA obtained from archived scales to compare the population structure among four sympatric landlocked populations of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) over a time frame of three to five generations. The same patterns of allele frequency distribution, theta, R-ST and genetic distance estimates were observed among populations for two time periods, confirming the temporal stability of the population structure. Despite population declines and stocking during this period, no statistically significant changes in intrapopulation genetic diversity were apparent. This study illustrates the feasibility and usefulness of microsatellite analysis of temporal samples, not only to infer changes of intrapopulation genetic diversity, but also to assess the stability of population structure over a time frame of several generations.},

  abstract = {Research on the relationship between the architecture of ecological networks and community stability has mainly focused on one type of interaction at a time, making difficult any comparison between different network types. We used a theoretical approach to show that the network architecture favoring stability fundamentally differs between trophic and mutualistic networks. A highly connected and nested architecture promotes community stability in mutualistic networks, whereas the stability of trophic networks is enhanced in compartmented and weakly connected architectures. These theoretical predictions are supported by a meta-analysis on the architecture of a large series of real pollination (mutualistic) and herbivory (trophic) networks. We conclude that strong variations in the stability of architectural patterns constrain ecological networks toward different architectures, depending on the type of interaction.},

Picking up where his influential The Coevolutionary Process left off, John N. Thompson synthesizes the state of a rapidly developing science that integrates approaches from evolutionary ecology, population genetics, phylogeography, systematics, evolutionary biochemistry and physiology, and molecular biology. Using models, data, and hypotheses to develop a complete conceptual framework, Thompson also draws on examples from a wide range of taxa and environments, illustrating the expanding breadth and depth of research in coevolutionary biology.},

  abstract = {1. Few theoretical studies have examined the impact of immigration and emigration on mutualist population dynamics, but a recent empirical study (A.R. Thompson Oecologia, 143, 61-69) on mutualistic fish and shrimp showed that immigration can prevent population collapse, and that intraspecific competition for a mutualistic partner can curb population expansion. To understand in a theoretical context the implications of these results, and to assess their generality, we present a two-species model that accounts explicitly for immigration and emigration, as well as distinguishing the impacts of mutualism on birth rates, death rates and habitat acquisition. 2. The model confirms that immigration can stabilize mutualistic populations, and predicts that high immigration, along with enhanced reproduction and/or reduced mortality through mutualism, can cause population sizes to increase until habitat availability curbs further expansion. 3. We explore in detail the effects of different forms of habitat limitation on mutualistic populations. Habitat availability commonly limits the density of both populations if mutualists acquire shelter independently. If a mutualist depends on a partner for habitat, densities of that mutualist are capped by the amount of space provided by that partner. The density of the shelter-provider is limited by the environment. 4. If a mutualism solely augments reproduction, and most locally produced individuals leave the focal patch, then the mutualism will have a minimal effect on local dynamics. If the mutualism operates by reducing rates of death or enhancing habitat availability, and there is at least some immigration, then mutualism will affect local dynamics. This finding may be particularly relevant in marine systems, where there is high variability (among species and locations) in the extent to which progeny disperse from natal locations. 5. Overall, our results demonstrate that the consequences of immigration and emigration for the dynamics of mutualists depend strongly on which demographic rate is influenced by mutualism. 6. By relating our model to a variety of terrestrial and aquatic systems, we provide a general framework to guide future empirical studies of the dynamics of mutualistic populations.},

  abstract = {We investigated the physiological and behavioral consequences for prey breeding at different distances from a nesting predator. In a natural setting, Pied Flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) made territory location decisions relative to established Sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) nests. From female flycatchers attending nests at different distances from Sparrowhawk nests, we measured body mass, blood stress protein (HSP60 and HSP70), and plasma immunoglobulin levels at the beginning (initial) and end (final) of the flycatcher breeding cycle, and provisioning rates during the nestling phase. We found that individuals breeding in closer proximity to Sparrowhawk nests, under higher perceived predation risk, showed significantly lower body mass, higher stress protein and immunoglobulin levels, and higher nestling provisioning rates compared to those individuals breeding farther away. Across the range of distances investigated (30-610 m), final stress protein levels decreased linearly with distance, whereas the final measures of the other variables showed unimodal trends, increasing or decreasing until an intermediate distance (approximately 350 m) and reversing the direction of the trend. Within 300 m, however, all measures showed significant linear associations with distance from the Sparrowhawk nest. Body mass and stress protein associations with distance from Sparrowhawk nests were only present during late breeding, and not in early incubation. Spatial proximity to Sparrowhawk nests consistently explained significant variation in both physiological and behavioral measures, despite the multitude of potential sources of variation for these measures in a natural setting. This suggests that predictable spatial patterns in these measures in avian communities are determined by the sites of breeding predators. Habitat selection decisions of migrant prey that vary only slightly spatially have consequences even at the cellular level, which plausibly have impacts on individual survival. In addition, this study suggests that predation risk is an important factor affecting physiological condition of prey, including stress protein induction in terrestrial vertebrates.},

While previous work has shown that adaptive alleles can be detected by comparing frequency trajectories from many replicate populations, this power comes at the expense of high-coverage (\&gt;100x) sequencing of many pooled samples, which can be cost-prohibitive. Here, we show that accurate estimates of allele frequencies can be achieved with very shallow sequencing depths (\&lt;5x) via inference of known founder haplotypes in small genomic windows. This technique can be used to efficiently estimate frequencies for any number of bi-allelic SNPs in populations of any model organism founded with sequenced homozygous strains. Using both experimentally-pooled and simulated samples of Drosophila melanogaster, we show that haplotype inference can improve allele frequency accuracy by orders of magnitude for up to 50 generations of recombination, and is robust to moderate levels of missing data, as well as different selection regimes. Finally, we show that a simple linear model generated from these simulations can predict the accuracy of haplotype-derived allele frequencies in other model organisms and experimental designs. To make these results broadly accessible for use in E+R experiments, we introduce HAF-pipe, an open-source software tool for calculating haplotype-derived allele frequencies from raw sequencing data. Ultimately, by reducing sequencing costs without sacrificing accuracy, our method facilitates E+R designs with higher replication and resolution, and thereby, increased power to detect adaptive alleles.},

  abstract = {Stochastic niche theory resolves many of the differences between neutral theory and classical tradeoff-based niche theories of resource competition and community structure. In stochastic niche theory, invading species become established only if propagules can survive stochastic mortality while growing to maturity on the resources left unconsumed by established species. The theory makes three predictions about community structure. First, stochastic niche assembly creates communities in which species dominate approximately equally wide "slices" of the habitat's spatial heterogeneity. These niche widths generate realistic distributions of species relative abundances for which, contrary to neutral theory but consistent with numerous observations, there are strong correlations among species traits, species abundances, and environmental conditions. Second, slight decreases in resource levels are predicted to cause large decreases in the probability that a propagule would survive to be an adult. These decreases cause local diversity to be limited by the inhibitory effects of resource use by established species on the establishment (recruitment) of potential invaders. If resource pulses or disturbance allowed invaders to overcome this recruitment limitation, many more species could indefinitely coexist. Third, the low invasibility of high diversity communities is predicted to result not from diversity per se, but from the uniformly low levels of resources that occur in high-diversity communities created by stochastic competitive assembly. This prediction provides a potential solution to the invasion paradox, which is the tendency for highly diverse regions to be more heavily invaded.},

  abstract = {A holistic evolutionary approach is used in the Gorongosa thesis in which emphasis is on the salient reciprocal relations and kinetic succession of land surfaces and biotic communities, influenced by landscape processes and prime mover components. As correlations of these relations and processes require both a total interacting framework and the details of its prime components, the thesis is divided into three main parts: (1) synopsis of the essence of the Gorongosa ecosystem and the approach used in field ecology (Perspective); (2) correlation of the physical and living components of the ecosystem; and (3) synthesis. The study attempts to relate the salient features of processes and correlations into a co-evolutionary whole, caught at that particular stage in space and time by the study. The chapter titled Process and Response is the central pivot of the thesis combining the kinetic aspects of geomorphological landscape changes with co-evolutionary sequences of biotic communities which change (expand, contract, and recombine) kaleidoscopically in space and time, in appearance and content. The prime movers in ecosystem change are on the physical side, nickpoint headward eroding sequences and edaphic change in soil moisture balance, and on the biotic side, the frugivores and large ungulate components which affect geomorphic and habitat modification are central. Of these, soil moisture appears to be the master factor. All climatic influences too, appear to be expressed through the edaphic controls which change in-situ, or with each geomorphic surface replacement sequence. This factor seems to orchestrate the opportunities and constraints from below on the possible community evolution possible in a particular time and place. From this, a template of salient factors of the Gorongosa ecosystem is provided for management, based on causes and trends in the kinetic evolution of the various ecosystems. To maintain a diversity of ecosystems in Gorongosa, the fundamental management action is to reinforce or reinstate the natural local base level sills which cause ponding of floodwaters responsible for the mosaic of grasslands and slack marshes of high primary productivity and ungulate carrying capacity. Concomittantly reductions of certain overpopulated ungulate species, chiefly hippo, are required so that management is effective. As natural processes are dynamic, it is necessary to identify and evaluate those salient factors operating at a particular time, as these key controls are altered and replaced by others through natural kinetic succession of landscapes and biotic communities. The salient factors governing the dynamics of an ecosystem or community thus require to be mapped at intervals, to provide templates of the trends and changing importance of key and master factors, in order to anticipate or predict what will result from their influences. With these data valid evaluation can be made with the other correlated information for meaningful management action.},

We expected that facilitation would be stronger at sites with more spatial associations. The four semiarid sites in Spain and the shrubland in Gran Sabana showed a high degree of positive species associations. Of the other two communities, one showed both positive and negative associations while negative ones predominated in Altos de Pipe. The direct experimental measure of neighbors' effect showed that positive interactions among species prevailed in communities where positive species associations dominated. The appearance of benefactor species in patches increased species richness compared with the surrounding inter-shrub spaces. Our results provide a link between spatial patterns and species interactions, where aggregation points to positive interactions and segregation to competitive or interference effects.

The regeneration patterns of this Mediterranean pine were analyzed across its distribution area, using data from 3226 plots of the Spanish National Forest Inventory. We aimed to test the hypothesis that seedlings establishment occurs under higher values of either canopy or shrub cover in the driest populations, as predicted by the stress-gradient hypothesis. Data were analyzed by means of Generalized Linear Models and multivariate methods. Results revealed that regeneration failure occurs on a regional scale, and that regeneration is facilitated by tree canopy cover of 55\%\textendash 80\%. A non-linear pattern of interaction along an aridity gradient was identified, with competition at the wettest site, high facilitation at the mid-dry sites, and low facilitation at the driest site. Evidence suggests that some shrub species may facilitate recruitment in the harsher areas. Collectively, our results reduce the possibilities of adapting forest management to drying climates by the application of alternative silvicultural prescriptions involving canopy cover.},

This phenomenon, called priority effects, has been observed in various types of communities, but it remains unclear whether priority effects persist over the long term spanning multiple generations of local communities in metacommunities. Focusing on bacteria and yeasts that colonize floral nectar of the sticky monkey flower, Mimulus aurantiacus, via hummingbirds and other flower-visiting animals, we experimentally manipulated initial microbial dominance on plants (regarded as metacommunities) to examine whether its effects persisted across multiple generations of flowers (regarded as local microbial habitats). The experimental introduction of Neokomagataea (= Gluconobacter) bacteria and Metschnikowia yeasts into wild flowers showed that the effects of initial dominance were observable across multiple floral generations. Three weeks after introduction, corresponding approximately to three floral generations, Neokomagataea introduction led to exclusion of yeasts, whereas Metschnikowia introduction did not result in the exclusion of Neokomagataea. Our results suggest that, even when local habitats are ephemeral, priority effects may influence multiple generations of local communities within metacommunities.},

We have sampled, sequenced, and assessed the diversity of genomes of validly named and tentative species of the Acinetobacter genus, a clade including major nosocomial pathogens and biotechnologically important species. Wein ferred a robust global phylogeny and delimited several new putative species. The genus is very ancient and extremely diverse: Genomes of highly divergent species share more orthologs than certain strains within a species. We systematically characterized elements and mechanisms driving genome diversification, such as conjugative elements, insertion sequences, and natural transformation. We found many error-prone polymerases that may play a role in resistance to toxins, antibiotics, and in the generation of genetic variation. Surprisingly, temperate phages, poorly studied in Acinetobacter, were found to account for a significant fraction of most genomes. Accordingly, many genomes encode clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas systems with some of the largest CRISPR-arrays found so far in bacteria. Integrons are strongly overrepresented in Acinetobacter baumannii, which correlates with its frequent resistance to antibiotics. Our data suggest that A. baumannii arose from an ancient population bottleneck followed by population expansion under strong purifying selection. The outstanding diversification of the species occurred largely by horizontal transfer, including some allelic recombination, at specific hotspots preferentially located close to the replication terminus. Our work sets a quantitative basis to understand the diversification of Acinetobacter into emerging resistant and versatile pathogens.},

However, not many studies have combined observations with experiments to assess the causal link between florivory and pollination. We conducted field observations at eight sites in northern California, combined with field experiments that involved artificial floral damage, to study the effect of florivory on pollination in the hummingbird-pollinated sticky monkeyflower, Mimulus aurantiacus. We used two indicators of pollinator visitation, stigma closure and the presence of microorganisms in floral nectar. The field observations revealed that stigma closure was less frequent in damaged flowers than in intact flowers. In the experiments, however, floral damage did not decrease stigma closure or microbial detection in nectar. Instead, neighbouring flowers were similar for both indicators. These results suggest that the observed negative association between florivory and pollination is not causal and that the location of flowers is more important to pollinator visitation than florivory in these populations of M. aurantiacus.},

Of invasive taxa, ants are among the most widespread and harmful. Highly invasive ants are often unicolonial. forming supercolonies in which workers and queens mix freely among physically separate nests. By reducing costs associated with territoriality, unicolonial species can attain high worker densities, allowing them to achieve interspecific dominance. Here we examine the behavior and population genetics of the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) in its native and introduced ranges, and we provide a mechanism to explain its success as an invader. Using microsatellite markers, we show that a population bottleneck has reduced the genetic diversity of introduced populations. This loss is associated with reduced intraspecific aggression among spatially separate nests, and leads to the formation of interspecifically dominant supercolonies. In contrast, native populations are more genetically variable and exhibit pronounced intraspecific aggression. Although reductions in genetic diversity are generally considered detrimental, these findings provide an example of how a genetic bottleneck can lead to widespread ecological success. In addition, these results provide insights into the origin and evolution of unicoloniality, which is often considered a challenge to kin selection theory.},

Furthermore, the causes of this variation remain unclear despite their fundamental importance in understanding species coexistence. Here, we show that one potential cause is environmental variability. In laboratory experiments using nectarinhabiting microorganisms as a model system, we manipulated spatial and temporal variability of temperature, and examined consequences for priority effects. If species arrived sequentially, multiple species coexisted under variable temperature, but not under constant temperature. Temperature variability prevented extinction of late-arriving species that would have been excluded owing to priority effects if temperature had been constant. By contrast, if species arrived simultaneously, species coexisted under both variable and constant temperatures.We propose possible mechanisms underlying these results using a mathematical model that incorporates contrasting effects of microbial species on nectar pH and amino acids. Overall, our findings suggest that understanding consequences of priority effects for species coexistence requires explicit consideration of environmental variability. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Each analysis assumes an additive polygenic trait with n diallelic loci under stabilizing selection. We allow loci to have different effects and consider equilibria at which the population mean departs from the stabilizing-selection optimum. Under weak selection, each model produces essentially identical, approximate allele-frequency dynamics. Variation is maintained under pleiotropic balancing selection only at loci for which the strength of balancing selection exceeds the effective strength of stabilizing selection. In addition, for all models, polymorphism requires that the population mean be close enough to the optimum that directional selection does not overwhelm balancing selection. This balance allows many simultaneously stable equilibria, and we explore their properties numerically. Both spatial and temporal G X E can maintain variation at loci for which the coefficient of variation (across environments) of the effect of a substitution exceeds a critical value greater than one. The critical value depends on the correlation between substitution effects at different loci. For large positive correlations (e.g., p(ij)(2) {$>$} 3/4), even extreme fluctuations in allelic effects cannot maintain variation. Surprisingly, this constraint on correlations implies that sex-dependent allelic effects cannot maintain polygenic variation. We present numerical results that support our analytical approximations and discuss our results in connection to relevant data and alternative variance-maintaining mechanisms.},

A field experiment with simulated nests of azure-winged magpies was carried out to test the hypothesis that this species nests in association with Japanese lesser sparrowhawks in order to reduce nest predation while paying few costs. The predation rate on nests was lower within 50 m of a hawk's nest during the incubation to nestling period than it was further away or at other stages of the breeding cycle. In addition, there was an inverse relationship between nest predation rate and hawk defence effort. Observations of natural nests showed that magpies did not defend their nests when nesting close to a hawk, and that hawks rarely preyed on magpies. Thus, magpies benefited from nesting close to hawks, while paying few or no costs},

Magpies preferred to nest close to hawk nests, and such sites had higher breeding success. However, Azure-winged Magpies nested in places with less leaf cover near hawk nests. Despite the lack of cover, the magpie nests were more successful when located near a hawk nest. Magpies effectively avoid nest predation by exploiting the defending behavior of the hawks.},

During 1990?1994 azure-winged magpies nested within 50 m of their nests in all of the hawk nest sites studied. During 2005 ? 2006, however, the magpies nested in only two of nine hawk nest sites. During the 1990s Japanese lesser sparrowhawks chased jungle crows away when they intruded within 50 m of their nest. During the 2000s, on the other hand, the hawks attempted to expel few crows at a distance of more than 10 m from their nest. As a result of it, the predation rate of simulated magpie nests located in the hawk nest sites was significantly higher during the 2000s. This suggests that the magpies have the ability to assess the defending behavior of the hawks and judge whether they can rely on their defense. Most azure-winged magpies may stop nesting in association with breeding Japanese lesser sparrowhawks because of the reduced defending range of their nest sites.},

These priority effects, which have been observed across a wide variety of ecosystems, often arise because early colonists have sufficient time to use available resources efficiently and subsequently withhold them from invaders. Here, we explore the extent to which rapid local adaptive evolution contributes to the pervasiveness of these priority effects. Using an individual-based simulation, we show that early colonization allows the descendants of colonists to adapt to novel conditions and reduce the establishment success of an initially ecologically equivalent competing species. Our model predicts that slight differences in colonization timing and adaptive capacity between species can substantially alter the dynamics and diversity of communities. We also show that priority effects and gene flow can generate a novel mechanism for the expansion and retraction of species distributions in a metacommunity. Our results suggest that local adaptation combined with stochastic colonization events can obscure direct relationships between species distributions and environmental gradients. Given the increasing recognition of rapid, microgeographic evolution in natural populations, we expect that evolutionary priority effects could affect the structure and dynamics of many natural metacommunities. \textcopyright{} 2009 The Royal Society.},

Prey arriving from predator-free patches might also have evolved weaker defenses against predators and thus enhance trophic subsidies by providing easily captured prey. Using local models assuming a linear or accelerating trade-off between defense and population growth rate, we demonstrate that immigration of undefended prey increased predator abundances and decreased defended prey through eco-evolutionary apparent competition. In individual-based models with spatial structure, explicit genetics, and gene flow along an environmental gradient, prey became maladapted to predators at the predator's range edge, and greater gene flow enhanced this maladaptation. The predator gained a subsidy from these easily captured prey, which enhanced its abundance, facilitated its persistence in marginal habitats, extended its range extent, and enhanced range shifts during environmental changes, such as climate change. Once the predator expanded, prey adapted to it and the advantage disappeared, resulting in an elastic predator range margin driven by eco-evolutionary dynamics. Overall, the results indicate a need to consider gene flow\textendash induced maladaptation and species interactions as mutual forces that frequently determine ecological and evolutionary dynamics and patterns in nature.},

Predation of Pochard and Tufted Duck nests was of similar extent and stronger outside than within gull colonies. An experiment with artficial nests also showed that a higher proportion of nests was preyed upon outside than within gull colonies (0.98 and 0.13, respectively). The results are consistent with the hypothesis that nest predation is lower within than outside gull colonies. Tufted Ducks nest more often with gulls than do Pochards; 61.5\% of Tufted Duck nests and 29.3\% of Pochard nests were found within gull colonies.},

During this time, a wave of new plant species emerged, presumably in response to the new climate. Interestingly, most Tertiary species that have been tracked through the fossil record did not disappear but remained relatively abundant despite the development of a much more unfavorable climate for species adapted to moist conditions. Here we find, by integrating paleobotanical, ecological, and phylogenetic analyses, that a large number of ancient Tertiary species in Mediterranean-climate ecosystems appear to have been preserved by the facilitative or "nurse" effects of modern Quaternary species. Our results indicate that these interdependent relationships among plants have played a central role in the preservation of the global biodiversity and provided a mechanism for stabilizing selection and the conservation of ecological traits over evolutionary time scales.},

Despite their abundance, the impact of soil microbes on ecosystem processes is still poorly understood. Here we explore the various roles that soil microbes play in terrestrial ecosystems with special emphasis on their contribution to plant productivity and diversity. Soil microbes are important regulators of plant productivity, especially in nutrient poor ecosystems where plant symbionts are responsible for the acquisition of limiting nutrients. Mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen-fixing bacteria are responsible for c. 5-20\% (grassland and savannah) to 80\% (temperate and boreal forests) of all nitrogen, and up to 75\% of phosphorus, that is acquired by plants annually. Free-living microbes also strongly regulate plant productivity, through the mineralization of, and competition for, nutrients that sustain plant productivity. Soil microbes, including microbial pathogens, are also important regulators of plant community dynamics and plant diversity, determining plant abundance and, in some cases, facilitating invasion by exotic plants. Conservative estimates suggest that c. 20 000 plant species are completely dependent on microbial symbionts for growth and survival pointing to the importance of soil microbes as regulators of plant species richness on Earth. Overall, this review shows that soil microbes must be considered as important drivers of plant diversity and productivity in terrestrial ecosystems. \textcopyright{} 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

We show that the bovine PAB was created approximately 20.7 million years ago by illegitimate intrachromatid recombination between inverted, ruminant-specific Bov-tA repeats. Accordingly, we demonstrate that cattle share their PAB with all other examined ruminants including sheep, but not with cetaceans or more distantly related mammals. We provide evidence that, since its creation, the ancestral ruminant PAB has been displaced by attrition, which occurs at variable rates in different species, and that it is capable of retreat by attrition erasure.

  abstract = {Mutualistic interactions are often subject to exploitation by species that are not directly involved in the mutualism. Understanding which organisms act as such 'third-party' species and how they do so is a major challenge in the current study of mutualistic interactions. Here, we show that even species that appear ecologically similar can have contrasting effects as third-party species. We experimentally compared the effects of nectar-inhabiting bacteria and yeasts on the strength of a mutualism between a hummingbird-pollinated shrub, Mimulus aurantiacus, and its pollinators. We found that the common bacterium Gluconobacter sp., but not the common yeast Metschnikowia reukaufii, reduced pollination success, seed set and nectar consumption by pollinators, thereby weakening the plant - pollinator mutualism. We also found that the bacteria reduced nectar pH and total sugar concentration more greatly than the yeasts did and that the bacteria decreased glucose concentration and increased fructose concentration whereas the yeasts affected neither. These distinct changes to nectar chemistry may underlie the microbes' contrasting effects on the mutualism. Our results suggest that it is necessary to understand the determinants of microbial species composition in nectar and their differential modification of floral rewards to explain the mutual benefits that plants and pollinators gain from each other. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

We manipulated dispersal of nectar-inhabiting bacteria and yeasts via flower-visiting animals to examine how dispersal influenced microbial beta diversity among flowers. Contrary to the prevailing view that dispersal lowers beta diversity, we found beta diversity was highest when dispersal was least limited. Our analysis suggested that this unexpected pattern might have resulted from stronger priority effects under increased dispersal. Dispersal is highly stochastic, generating variability in species arrival history and consequently the potential for community divergence via priority effects, in these and likely many other microbial, plant, and animal communities. Yet most previous experiments eliminated this possibility. We suggest that the positive effects of dispersal on beta diversity, like the one we report here, may have been greatly underappreciated.},

In Hymenoptera sex is usually determined by a single locus, heterozygotes are female and hemizygotes are male. Under inbreeding, homozygous diploid and sterile males occur which form a genetic burden for a population. We review life history and genetical traits that may overcome the disadvantages of single locus complementary sex determination (sl-CSD). Behavioural adaptations to avoid matings between relatives include active dispersal from natal patches and mating preferences for nonrelatives. In non-social species, temporal and spatial segregation of male and female offspring reduces the burden of sl-CSD. In social species, diploid males are produced at the expense of workers and female reproductives. In some social species, diploid males and diploid male producing queens are killed by workers. Diploid male production may have played a role in the evolution or maintenance of polygyny (multiple queens) and polyandry (multiple mating). Some forms of thelytoky (parthenogenetic female production) increase homozygosity and are therefore incompatible with sl-CSD. We discuss a number of hypothetical adaptations to sl-CSD which should be considered in future studies of this insect order.},

Despite compelling empirical evidence, there is no general framework for elucidating how and when selection will allow coexistence in natural communities. Here we develop such a framework for a mechanism that we term "neighbor-dependent selection." We show that this mechanism can both augment coexistence when ecological conditions allow for niche partitioning and enable coexistence when ecological conditions lead to competitive exclusion. The novel insight is that when ecological conditions lead to exclusion, neighbor-dependent selection can allow coexistence via cycles driven by an intransitive loop; selection causes one species to be a superior interspecific competitor when it is rare and an inferior interspecific competitor when it is abundant. Our framework predicts the conditions under which selection can enable coexistence, as opposed to merely augmenting it, and elucidates the effects of heritability on the eco-evolutionary feedbacks that drive coexistence. Given increasing evidence that evolution operates on ecological timescales, our approach provides one means for evaluating the role of selection and trait evolution in species coexistence. \textcopyright{} 2011 by The University of Chicago.},

  abstract = {Community ecology is often perceived as a "mess," given the seemingly vast number of processes that can underlie the many patterns of interest, and the apparent uniqueness of each study system. However, at the most general level, patterns in the composition and diversity of species-the subjectmatter of community ecology-are influenced by only four classes of process: selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal Selection represents deterministic fitness differences among species, drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance, speciation creates new species, and dispersal is the movement of organisms across space. All theoretical and conceptual models in community ecology can be understood with respect to their emphasis on these four processes. Empirical evidence exists for all of these processes and many of their interactions, with a predominance of studies on selection. Organizing the material of community ecology according to this framework can clarify the essential similarities and differences among the many conceptual and theoretical approaches to the discipline, and it can also allow for the articulation of a very general theory of community dynamics: species are added to communities via speciation and dispersal, and the relative abundances of these species are then shaped by drift and selection, as well as ongoing dispersal, to drive community dynamics.

  abstract = {Background: Transposable elements (TEs) are an important source of genomic variability in eukaryotic genomes. Their activity impacts genome architecture and gene expression and can lead to drastic phenotypic changes. Therefore, identifying TE polymorphisms is key to better understand the link between genotype and phenotype. However, most genotype-to-phenotype analyses have concentrated on single nucleotide polymorphisms as they are easier to reliable detect using short-read data. Many bioinformatic tools have been developed to identify transposon insertions from resequencing data using short reads. Nevertheless, the performance of most of these tools has been tested using simulated insertions, which do not accurately reproduce the complexity of natural insertions. Results: We have overcome this limitation by building a dataset of insertions from the comparison of two highquality rice genomes, followed by extensive manual curation. This dataset contains validated insertions of two very different types of TEs, LTR-retrotransposons and MITEs. Using this dataset, we have benchmarked the sensitivity and precision of 12 commonly used tools, and our results suggest that in general their sensitivity was previously overestimated when using simulated data. Our results also show that, increasing coverage leads to a better sensitivity but with a cost in precision. Moreover, we found important differences in tool performance, with some tools performing better on a specific type of TEs. We have also used two sets of experimentally validated insertions in Drosophila and humans and show that this trend is maintained in genomes of different size and complexity. Conclusions: We discuss the possible choice of tools depending on the goals of the study and show that the appropriate combination of tools could be an option for most approaches, increasing the sensitivity while maintaining a good precision.},

Indeed, among the 4000 or so known species of aphids about 250 are pests, and in temperate regions several are economically important agricultural pests that damage crops directly during feeding or act as vectors for plant pathogens. But aphids are also important model organisms in evolutionary biology and ecology because they combine a number of unique features such as complex life cycles involving the development of morphological distinct phenotypes (polyphenism), sexual and asexual reproduction strategies and changes of host plants. Aphids can also be regarded as holobionts because they are colonized by obligate and facultative microbes which enable them to feed exclusively on phloem sap and influence their resistance against pathogens, parasitoids or environmental stress. This book combines fundamental information about aphids with chapters addressing state-of-the-art research in topics such as aphid-related phylogeny, genome biology, epigenetics and chemical ecology. The chapters have been compiled by experts in the field to provide a valuable and accessible source of information for researchers and for students in biology, ecology and agriculture.},

Although much recent progress has been made possible because of the rising of multiple data streams, new developments in ecoinformatics, and new methodological advances, future directions should provide a theoretical and comprehensive framework for the scaling of biotic interactions across trophic levels and its ecological implications.},

Separating signatures of clinal adaptation from signatures of other evolutionary forces, such as demographic processes, genetic drift and adaptation, to nonclinal conditions of the immediate local environment is a major challenge. Here, we examine climate adaptation in five natural populations of the harlequin fly Chironomus riparius sampled along a climatic gradient across Europe. Our study integrates experimental data, individual genome resequencing, Pool-Seq data and population genetic modelling. Common-garden experiments revealed significantly different population growth rates at test temperatures corresponding to the population origin along the climate gradient, suggesting thermal adaptation on the phenotypic level. Based on a population genomic analysis, we derived empirical estimates of historical demography and migration. We used an FST outlier approach to infer positive selection across the climate gradient, in combination with an environmental association analysis. In total, we identified 162 candidate genes as genomic basis of climate adaptation. Enriched functions among these candidate genes involved the apoptotic process and molecular response to heat, as well as functions identified in studies of climate adaptation in other insects. Our results show that local climate conditions impose strong selection pressures and lead to genomic adaptation despite strong gene flow. Moreover, these results imply that selection to different climatic conditions seems to converge on a functional level, at least between different insect species.},

The stomachs of 286 Nile Crocodiles (17\textendash 166 cm snout\textendash vent length) were lavaged over a two-year period. Taking prey residence times into account, the contents were examined for prey eaten within 24 h. Crocodylus niloticus has a similar ontogenetic shift in diet to that of other crocodilians. Yearlings consumed primarily aquatic insecta and arachnida. As crocodile size increased (juveniles), the diet became more diverse including crustacea, amphibia, and fish. The largest size class (subadults) consumed primarily fish. Yearlings fed consistently throughout the year; however a higher proportion of empty stomachs occurred within the juvenile and subadult size classes during the winter months. Seven species of nematodes were found within the stomachs...},

  abstract = {Unifying ecosystem ecology and evolutionary biology promises a more complete understanding of the processes that link different levels of biological organization across space and time. Feedbacks across levels of organization link theory associated with eco-evolutionary dynamics, niche construction and the geographic mosaic theory of co-evolution. We describe a conceptual model, which builds upon previous work that shows how feedback among different levels of biological organization can link ecosystem and evolutionary processes over space and time. We provide empirical examples across terrestrial and aquatic systems that indicate broad generality of the conceptual framework and discuss its macroevolutionary consequences. Our conceptual model is based on three premises: genetically based species interactions can vary spatially and temporally from positive to neutral (i.e. no net feedback) to negative and drive evolutionary change; this evolutionary change can drive divergence in niche construction and ecosystem function; and lastly, such ecosystem-level effects can reinforce spatiotemporal variation in evolutionary dynamics. Just as evolution can alter ecosystem function locally and across the landscape differently, variation in ecosystem processes can drive evolution locally and across the landscape differently. By highlighting our current knowledge of eco-evolutionary feedbacks in ecosystems, as well as information gaps, we provide a foundation for understanding the interplay between biodiversity and ecosystem function through an eco-evolutionary lens. A plain language summary is available for this article.},

Our study aimed to elucidate the physiological mechanism of cryptobiosis in the highest cryptobiotic invertebrate, Polypedilum vanderplanki. Larvae of this insect rapidly accumulated a large amount of the carbohydrate,trehalose, (18\% of dry body mass) during desiccation for 2 days, suggesting that a high level of trehalose accumulation contributed to the successful induction of cryptobiosis in P. vanderplanki as well as in other lower cryptobiotic organisms. When larvae deprived of the brain,suboesophageal ganglion (SG) and thoracic ganglia (TG) were completely dehydrated and then rehydrated, they were able to recover and move actively. During desiccation, such larvae also accumulated trehalose, although only about half as much as the intact larvae. It is concluded that the brain, SG and TG do not affect the induction and termination of cryptobiosis, and hence in this higher multicellular animal cryptobiosis is independent of brain, SG and TG regulation, just as in plants or in unicellular organisms.},

Discriminant analysis has been used to distinguish males from females on the basis of external measurements of both the whole animal and the isolated head. Hatchling C.porosus from Arnhem Bay and the Blyth River have longer heads than those from the Liverpool River. C. porosus from Sarawak have longer tails and are heavier than those from northern Australia.

In this review, we argue that, despite inherent challenges associated with reconstructing historical processes, the interplay of ecology and evolution is central to our understanding of macroevolution and community coexistence, and cannot be safely ignored in community and comparative phylogenetic studies. We highlight new research avenues that foster greater consideration of both ecological and evolutionary dynamics as processes that occur along branches of phylogenetic trees. By promoting new ways forward using this perspective, we hope to inspire further integration that creatively co-utilizes phylogenies and ecological data to study eco-evolutionary dynamics over time and space.},

We tested for the occurrence of genetic variation in winged morph production by rearing individuals from red and green clones of pea aphid under wing-inducing (crowding) and control conditions, and scored the phenotypes of their offspring. Clones differed significantly in alate production and red clones produced on average a higher proportion of winged morphs than green clones. Importantly, however, there was considerable variation between clones of the same colour. Broad-sense heritabilities of winged morph production were 0.69 (crowding treatment) and 0.63 (control). Clones also differed in the number of offspring they produced. When exposed to the crowding stimulus, aphids deferred offspring production, resulting in a higher number of offspring produced in the crowding treatment than in the control.},

Despite recent breakthroughs in next generation sequencing, there remains a limited representation of beetle diversity in assembled genomes. Most notably, the ground beetle family Carabidae, comprising more than 40,000 described species, has not been studied in a comparative genomics framework using whole genome data. Here we generate a high-\-quality genome assembly for Nebria riversi, to examine sources of novelty in the genome evolution of beetles, as well as genetic changes associated with specialization to high-\-elevation alpine habitats. In particular, this genome resource provides a foundation for expanding comparative molecular research into mechanisms of insect cold adaptation. Comparison to other beetles shows a strong signature of genome compaction, with N. riversi possessing a relatively small genome (\textasciitilde 147 Mb) compared to other beetles, with associated reductions in repeat element content and intron length. Small genome size is not, however, associated with fewer protein-\-coding genes, and an analysis of gene family diversity shows significant expansions of genes associated with cellular membranes and membrane transport, as well as protein phosphorylation and muscle filament structure. Finally, our genomic analyses show that these high-\-elevation beetles have endosymbiotic Spiroplasma, with several metabolic pathways (e.g., propanoate biosynthesis) that might complement N. riversi, although its role as a beneficial symbiont or as a reproductive parasite remains equivocal.},

We consider six economic strategies used by microbes to optimize their success in markets. We argue that an economic market framework is a useful tool to generate specific and interesting predictions about microbial interactions, including the evolution of partner discrimination, hoarding strategies, specialized versus diversified mutualistic services, and the role of spatial structures, such as flocks and consortia. There is untapped potential for studying the evolutionary dynamics of microbial systems. Market theory can help structure this potential by characterizing strategic investment of microbes across a diversity of conditions.},

One of the factors that may stabilize mutualistic interactions is when individuals preferentially reward more mutualistic (beneficial) behaviour and {$\fracslash$} or punish less mutualistic (more parasitic) behaviour. We develop a model that shows how such sanctions provide a fitness benefit to the individuals that carry them out. Although this approach could be applied to a number of symbioses, we focus on how it could be applied to the legume- rhizobia interaction. Specifically, we demonstrate how plants can be selected to supply preferentially more resources to (or be less likely to senesce) nodules that are fixing more N2 (termed plant sanctions). We have previously argued that appreciable levels of N2 fixation by rhizobia are only likely to be selected for in response to plant sanctions. Therefore, by showing that plant sanctions can also be favoured by natural selection, we are able to provide an explanation for the stability of the plant-legume mutualism.},

A central question is whether mutualisms persist because hosts have evolved costly punishment of cheaters. Here, we use the economic theory of employment contracts to formulate and distinguish between two mechanisms that have been proposed to prevent cheating in host\textendash symbiont mutualisms, partner fidelity feedback (PFF) and host sanctions (HS). Under PFF, positive feedback between host fitness and symbiont fitness is sufficient to prevent cheating; in contrast, HS posits the necessity of costly punishment to maintain mutualism. A coevolutionary model of mutualism finds that HS are unlikely to evolve de novo, and published data on legume\textendash rhizobia and yucca\textendash moth mutualisms are consistent with PFF and not with HS. Thus, in systems considered to be textbook cases of HS, we find poor support for the theory that hosts have evolved to punish cheating symbionts; instead, we show that even horizontally transmitted mutualisms can be stabilized via PFF. PFF theory may place previously underappreciated constraints on the evolution of mutualism and explain why punishment is far from ubiquitous in nature.},

The habitat is a mixed hardwood forest, in places modified by the nesting of generations of wading birds and cormorants. During a three-year period, 651 snakes were captured, 155 females were dissected, and ovaries from 127 were preserved. The snakes form male-female pairs during all months of the year. Some gravid females aggregated. Island snakes bear larger young (332 mm) than do those from the Florida mainland and Mississippi. Males less than 650 mm (total length) and females under 800 mm were considered immature. Males are capable of breeding in the late summer of their second year; females, in the fall of their third year. Males appear fertile the year around, and females were found to contain sperm in winter. Ripe females were heavily inseminated, and the few gravid individuals tested were negative for sperm. Females reproduce in alternate years, as indicated by the presence or absence of developing eggs or young, comparison of ovarian eggs, and absence of resorptive phenomena. Island cottonmouths reproduce with far less fat reserves than do rattlesnakes and European vipers, and depletion of energy reserves through pregnancy does not offer a satisfactory explanation for biennial reproduction. Length of time at certain temperatures and intrinsic factors are suggested as more likely influences. Apparently, island snakes grow more slowly than mainland individuals, perhaps due to restricted seasonal food intake and winter activity which deprives them of growth energy. As a population, the cottonmouths were actually losing weight, possibly due to changes in the rookeries they scavenge, or to handling.},

Savannah sparrows, Passerculus sandwichensis, breeding on Kent Island, New Brunswick, Canada, have two types of nest predators, one of them (herring gulls, Larus argentatus) abundant but relatively ineffective, the other (American crows, Corvus brachyrhynchos) scarce but highly effective. We hypothesized that the net effect for Savannah sparrows of nesting near gulls would be to reduce the overall risk of nest predation. Despite being surrounded by predators, the eggs and offspring of sparrows that nested among gulls survived as well during the incubation and post-fledging periods as did those of sparrows that did not nest among gulls. During the nestling period, sparrows nesting among gulls had significantly lower predation rates. In defending their own nests from predatory crows, gulls apparently shielded nearby sparrows from the more dangerous predator. Experiments with model predators demonstrated that sparrows reacted to gulls as potential predators of their eggs and nestlings. Sparrows apparently recognized crows as a far greater threat, however. The tendency to nest near gulls appeared not to be heritable or influenced by early experience. Sparrows nesting among gulls were indistinguishable from sparrows nesting away from gulls in terms of body size, age and date of nesting. By choosing nest sites in microhabitats that gulls avoided, such as dense patches of goldenrod and blueberry, and by adopting more cautious approaches to their nests, sparrows nesting near gulls reduced their risk of predation by gulls. The density of Savannah sparrow nests was inversely correlated with the density of gull nests, which suggests that sparrows avoided gulls despite the apparent advantage in terms of reduced nest predation by crows. A strong nesting association between gulls and birds like Savannah sparrows is unlikely to evolve because of the low heritability of the trait, gene flow from other populations where avoiding gulls and other potential predators is selectively advantageous, and constraints on short-lived birds in learning to differentiate situations in which a predator presents a threat from those in which it provides protection.},

These regions are defined as sharing no statistical support for homology with any other sequence in the set, which can result from e.g. sequencing errors or gene prediction errors creating frameshifts. Our methodology is implemented in the program PREQUAL, which is a fast and accurate tool for high-throughput filtering of sequences. The program is primarily aimed at amino acid sequences, although it can handle protein coding DNA sequences as well. It is fully customizable to allow fine-tuning of the filtering sensitivity.},

  abstract = {Reproductive isolation between species is often caused by deleterious interactions among loci in hybrids. Finding the genes involved in these incompatibilities provides insight into the mechanisms of speciation. With recently diverged subspecies, house mice provide a powerful system for understanding the genetics of reproductive isolation early in the speciation process. Although previous studies have yielded important clues about the genetics of hybrid male sterility in house mice, they have been restricted to F1 sterility or incompatibilities involving the X chromosome. To provide a more complete characterization of this key reproductive barrier, we conducted an F2 intercross between wild-derived inbred strains from two subspecies of house mice, Mus musculus musculus and Mus musculus domesticus. We identified a suite of autosomal and X-linked QTL that underlie measures of hybrid male sterility, including testis weight, sperm density, and sperm morphology. In many cases, the autosomal loci were unique to a specific sterility trait and exhibited an effect only when homozygous, underscoring the importance of examining reproductive barriers beyond the F1 generation. We also found novel two-locus incompatibilities between the M. m. musculus X chromosome and M. m. domesticus autosomal alleles. Our results reveal a complex genetic architecture for hybrid male sterility and suggest a prominent role for reproductive barriers in advanced generations in maintaining subspecies integrity in house mice.},

Although progress has been made in characterizing the outcomes of these evolutionary processes on vertebrate sex chromosomes, it is still unclear how recombination suppression and sequence divergence typically occur and how gene dosage imbalances are resolved in the heterogametic sex. The threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is a powerful model system to explore vertebrate sex chromosome evolution, as it possesses an XY sex chromosome pair at relatively early stages of differentiation. Using a combination of whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing, we characterized sequence evolution and gene expression across the sex chromosomes. We uncovered two distinct evolutionary strata that correspond with known structural rearrangements on the Y chromosome. In the oldest stratum, only a handful of genes remain, and these genes are under strong purifying selection. By comparing sex-linked gene expression with expression of autosomal orthologs in an outgroup, we show that dosage compensation has not evolved in threespine sticklebacks through upregulation of the X chromosome in males. Instead, in the oldest stratum, the genes that still possess a Y chromosome allele are enriched for genes predicted to be dosage sensitive in mammals and yeast. Our results suggest that dosage imbalances may have been avoided at haploinsufficient genes by retaining function of the Y chromosome allele through strong purifying selection.},

  abstract = {We present evidence that the heritable genetic variation within individual species, especially dominant and keystone species, has community and ecosystem consequences. These consequences represent extended phenotypes, i.e., the effects of genes at levels higher than the population. Using diverse examples from microbes to vertebrates, we demonstrate that the extended phenotype can be traced from the individuals possessing the trait, to the community, and to ecosystem processes such as leaf litter decomposition and N mineralization. In our development of a community genetics perspective, we focus on intraspecific genetic variation because the extended phenotypes of these genes can be passed from one generation to the next, which provides a mechanism for heritability. In support of this view, common-garden experiments using synthetic crosses of a dominant tree show that their progeny tend to support arthropod communities that resemble those of their parents. We also argue that the combined interactions of extended phenotypes contribute to the among-community variance in the traits of individuals within communities. The genetic factors underlying this among-community variance in trait expression, particularly those involving genetic interactions among species, constitute community heritability. These findings have diverse implications. (1) They provide a genetic framework for understanding community structure and ecosystem processes. The effects of extended phenotypes at these higher levels need not be diffuse; they may be direct or may act in relatively few steps, which enhances our ability to detect and predict their effects. (2) From a conservation perspective, we introduce the concept of the minimum viable interacting population (MVIP), which represents the size of a population needed to maintain genetic diversity at levels required by other interacting species in the community. (3) Genotype X environment interactions in dominant and keystone species can shift extended phenotypes to have unexpected consequences at community and ecosystem levels, an issue that is especially important as it relates to global change. (4) Documenting community heritability justifies a community genetics perspective and is an essential first step in demonstrating community evolution. (5) Community genetics requires and promotes an integrative approach, from genes to ecosystems, that is necessary for the marriage of ecology and genetics. Few studies span from genes to ecosystems, but such integration is probably essential for understanding the natural world.},

Small populations therefore accumulate deleterious mutations. Left unchecked, the effect of these fixed alleles is to reduce the reproductive capacity of a species, eventually to the point of extinction. New beneficial mutations, if fixed by selection, can restore some of this lost fitness. This paper derives the overall change in fitness due to fixation of new deleterious and beneficial alleles, as a function of the distribution of effects of new mutations and the effective population size. There is a critical effective size below which a population will on average decline in fitness, but above which beneficial mutations allow the population to persist. With reasonable estimates of the relevant parameters, this critical effective size is likely to be a few hundred. Furthermore, sexual selection can act to reduce the fixation probability of deleterious new mutation...},

These schemes evaluate biological and historical characteristics of species and prioritize those that should be the focus of exclusion, quarantine, and/or control. However, it is not clear how commonly these schemes take microevolutionary considerations into account. We review the recent literature and find that rapid evolutionary changes are common during invasions. These evolutionary changes include rapid adaptation of invaders to new environments, effects of hybridization, and evolution in recipient communities. Strikingly, we document 38 species in which the specific traits commonly associated with invasive potential (e.g. growth rate, dispersal ability, generation time) have themselves undergone evolutionary change following introduction, in some cases over very short ({$<$}= 10 year) timescales. In contrast, our review of 29 ISPS spanning plant, animal, and microbial taxa shows that the majority (76\%) envision invading species and recipient communities as static entities. Those that incorporate evolutionary considerations do so in a limited way. Evolutionary change not only affects the predictive power of these schemes, but also complicates their evaluation. We argue that including the evolutionary potential of species and communities in ISPS is overdue, present several metrics related to evolutionary potential that could be incorporated in ISPS, and provide suggestions for further research on these metrics and their performance. Finally, we argue that the fact of evolutionary change during invasions begs for added caution during risk assessment.},

While Brownian motion simulations of single molecules are often too time consuming to represent the mesoscopic level, the classical Gillespie algorithm is a stochastically exact algorithm that provides satisfying results in the representation of calcium microdomains. Gillespie's algorithm can be approximated via the tau-leap method and the chemical Langevin equation (CLE). Both methods lead to a substantial acceleration in computation time and a relatively small decrease in accuracy. Elimination of the noise terms leads to the classical, deterministic reaction rate equations (RRE). For complex multiscale systems, hybrid simulations are increasingly proposed to combine the advantages of stochastic and deterministic algorithms. An often used exemplary cell type in this context are striated muscle cells (e.g., cardiac and skeletal muscle cells). The properties of these cells are well described and they express many common calcium-dependent signaling pathways. The purpose of the present paper is to provide an overview of the aforementioned simulation approaches and their mutual relationships in the spectrum ranging from stochastic to deterministic algorithms.},

We also review other areas where it may be important but has generally been overlooked, in both ecology (e.g. food webs, disease ecology, mutualistic interactions) and conservation (e.g. habitat modification). We summarize methods for testing for NC, and suggest that a commonly used and advocated method (involving a test for phylogenetic signal) is potentially problematic, and describe alternative approaches. We suggest that considering NC: (1) focuses attention on the within-species processes that cause traits to be conserved over time, (2) emphasizes connections between questions and research areas that are not obviously related (e.g. invasives, global warming, tropical richness), and (3) suggests new areas for research (e.g. why are some clades largely nocturnal? why do related species share diseases?).},

Predation was especially intense in woodlots near suburban neighborhoods compared to woodlots in isolated rural areas.

In either position these open\textemdash cup nests were move vulnerable to predators than experimental cavity nests.

  abstract = {1. The zoogeography of the Melanesian ponerine fauna is preliminarily analyzed. Most of the fauna has apparently been derived ultimately from Oriental stocks entering by way of New Guinea; some invading species are able to spread beyond this island to Queensland and outer Melanesia. A smaller part of the fauna has been derived from old Australian stocks that have entered by way of New Guinea or New Caledonia. Faunal flow from New Guinea through outer Melanesia has been unidirectional, with an ever diminishing number of species groups found outward from the Bismarcks to the Fiji Islands. New Caledonia draws almost all of its fauna from eastern Australia and has engaged in very little direct faunal exchange with the remainder of Melanesia. 2. A cyclical pattern of expansion, diversification, and contraction is hypothesized to account for later evolutionary events following initial dispersal. Following invasion of Melanesia (Stage I, primary), the pioneer populations may then diverge to species level (Stage II) and further diversify. Eventually the source populations outside Melanesia tend to contract, leaving the species group as a whole peripheral and Melanesian-centered (Stage III). Endemic Melanesian species occasionally enter upon a secondary phase of expansion (Stage I, secondary) but are rarely if ever able to push beyond Australia or the Philippines. 3. Stage-I species are characterized on New Guinea by their greater concentration in "marginal" habitats, including open lowland forest, savanna, and littoral. The central habitats, including denser lowland forest and montane forest, contain significantly larger faunas as well as a higher percentage of Stage-II and Stage-III species. Stage-I species are also characterized by their individual occurrence in a greater range of major habitats. Finally, these species make up a significantly higher proportion of the faunas of the archipelagos of central Melanesia, including the Bismarck Archipelago, the Solomon Islands, and the New Hebrides. 4. On the basis of these data it is suggested that ponerine species normally invade New Guinea by way of the marginal habitats. Evolutionary opportunity is nevertheless limited in the marginal habitats, and there is a strong selective pressure favoring re-entry into the inner rain forest habitats. In general, Stages II and III, leading to the origin of the great bulk of the Melanesian fauna and its most distinctive endemic elements, are played out only in the inner rain forest.},

In this article, we take a "back to basics" approach, explaining what group selection is, why its rejection was regarded as so important, and how it has been revived based on a more careful formulation and subsequent research. Multilevel selection theory (including group selection) provides an elegant theoretical foundation for sociobiology in the future, once its turbulent past is appropriately understood.},

  abstract = {The role of symbiosis in bacterial symbiont genome evolution is well understood, yet the ways that symbiosis shapes host genomes or more particularly, host/symbiont genome coevolution in the holobiont is only now being revealed. Here, we identify three coevolutionary signatures that characterize holobiont genomes. The first signature, host/symbiont collaboration, arises when completion of essential pathways requires host/endosymbiont genome complementarity. Metabolic collaboration has evolved numerous times in the pathways of amino acid and vitamin biosynthesis. Here, we highlight collaboration in branched-chain amino acid and pantothenate (vitamin B5) biosynthesis. The second coevolutionary signature is acquisition, referring to the observation that holobiont genomes acquire novel genetic material through various means, including gene duplication, lateral gene transfer from bacteria that are not their current obligate symbionts, and full or partial endosymbiont replacement. The third signature, constraint, introduces the idea that holobiont genome evolution is constrained by the processes governing symbiont genome evolution. In addition, we propose that collaboration is constrained by the expression profile of the cell lineage from which endosymbiont-containing host cells, called bacteriocytes, are derived. In particular, we propose that such differences in bacteriocyte cell lineage may explain differences in patterns of host/endosymbiont metabolic collaboration between the sap-feeding suborders Sternorrhyncha and Auchenorrhynca. Finally, we review recent studies at the frontier of symbiosis research that are applying functional genomic approaches to characterization of the developmental and cellular mechanisms of host/endosymbiont integration, work that heralds a new era in symbiosis research.},

Theory suggests, however, that these same priority effects make it difficult for species to coexist in the region unless individuals are continuously supplied from an external species pool, often an unrealistic assumption. Here we develop an eco-evolutionary hypothesis to solve this conundrum. We build a metacommunity model in which local priority effects occur between two species via interspecific interference. Within each species there are two genotypes: one is more resistant to interspecific interference than the other but pays a fitness cost for its resistance. Because of this trade-off, species evolve to become less resistant as they become regionally more common. Rare species can then invade some local patches and consequently recover in regional frequency. This ``eco-evolutionary buffering'' enables the regional coexistence of species despite local priority effects, even in the absence of immigration from an external species pool. Our model predicts that eco-evolutionary buffering is particularly effective when local communities are small and connected by infrequent dispersal.},

  abstract = {Now in widespread use, generalized additive models (GAMs) have evolved into a standard statistical methodology of considerable flexibility. While Hastie and Tibshirani's outstanding 1990 research monograph on GAMs is largely responsible for this, there has been a long-standing need for an accessible introductory treatment of the subject that also emphasizes recent penalized regression spline approaches to GAMs and the mixed model extensions of these models. Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction with R imparts a thorough understanding of the theory and practical applications of GAMs and related advanced models, enabling informed use of these very flexible tools. The author bases his approach on a framework of penalized regression splines, and builds a well-grounded foundation through motivating chapters on linear and generalized linear models. While firmly focused on the practical aspects of GAMs, discussions include fairly full explanations of the theory underlying the methods. Use of the freely available R software helps explain the theory and illustrates the practicalities of linear, generalized linear, and generalized additive models, as well as their mixed effect extensions. The treatment is rich with practical examples, and it includes an entire chapter on the analysis of real data sets using R and the author's add-on package mgcv. Each chapter includes exercises, for which complete solutions are provided in an appendix. Concise, comprehensive, and essentially self-contained, Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction with R prepares readers with the practical skills and the theoretical background needed to use and understand GAMs and to move on to other GAM-related methods and models, such as SS-ANOVA, P-splines, backfitting and Bayesian approaches to smoothing and additive modelling.},

  abstract = {Several studies have demonstrated the ecological consequences of genetic variation within a single plant species. For example, these studies show that individual plant genotypes support unique composition of the plants' associated arthropod community. By contrast, fewer studies have explored how plant genetic variation may influence evolutionary dynamics in the plant's associated species. Here, we examine how aphids respond evolutionarily to genetic variation in their host plant. We conducted two experiments to examine local adaptation and rapid evolution of the free-feeding aphidChaitophorus populicolaacross genetic variants of its host plant,Populus angustifolia. To test for local adaptation, we collected tree cuttings and aphid colonies from three sites along an elevation/climate gradient and conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment. In general, home aphids (aphids transplanted onto trees from the same site) produced 1.7-3.4 times as many offspring as foreign aphids (aphids transplanted onto trees from different sites). To test for rapid evolution, we used 4 clonally replicated aphid genotypes and transplanted each onto 5 clonally replicatedP. angustifoliagenotypes. Each tree genotype started with the same aphid genotype composition. After 21 days (similar to two aphid generations), aphid genotype composition changed (i.e., aphids evolved) and some tree genotypes supported unique evolutionary trajectories of aphids. These results suggest that plant evolution in response to human perturbation, such as climate change and invasive species, will also result in evolutionary responses in strongly interacting species that could cascade to affect whole communities.},

  abstract = {It is now well established that mutations within cis-regulatory regions are responsible for various significant evolutionary differences in organismal traits. It has been proposed that cis-regulatory mutations make a qualitatively distinct contribution to trait evolution, in part because they might result in more limited pleiotropy and therefore fewer functional trade-offs, and in part because they might commonly be co-dominant and therefore immediately visible to selection. Many species-specific differences in cuticular colouration in fruitflies are the product of mutations in the cis-regulatory regions of yellow (y), ebony (e) and bric a brac 1/2 (bab1/bab2). The loss of pelvic armour in stickleback fish has evolved repeatedly through cis-regulatory mutations in paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 1 (pitx1). Many traits that are unique to humans or that vary among them are also due to mutations within cis-reguatory regions, including functionally significant mutations near Duffy blood group, chemokine receptor (DARC), lactase (LCT) and prodynorphin (PDYN). Taken collectively, the evidence from the best-studied cases supports the idea that cis-regulatory mutations make a qualitatively distinctive contribution to trait evolution.},

Host-specific pests reduce recruitment near reproductive adults (the JanzenConnell effect), and, negative density dependence occurs over larger spatial scales among the more abundant species and may regulate their populations. A fourth hypothesis, that suppressed understory plants rarely come into competition with one another, has not been considered before and has profound implications for species coexistence. These hypotheses are mutually compatible. Infrequent competition among suppressed understory plants, niche differences, and Janzen-Connell effects may facilitate the coexistence of the many rare plant species found in tropical forests while negative density dependence regulates the few most successful and abundant species.},

Thorough model assessments can uncover inadequacies and allow for deeper ecological insight by exploring structure in the observed data not accounted for by a model. We introduce occupancy model residual definitions that utilize the posterior distribution of the partially latent occupancy states. Residual-based assessments are valuable because they can target specific assumptions and identify ways to improve a model, such as adding spatial correlation or meaningful covariates. Our approach defines separate residuals for occupancy and detection, and we use simulation to examine whether missing structure for modeling detection probabilities can be distinguished from that for occupancy probabilities. In many scenarios, our residual diagnostics were able to separate inadequacies at the different model levels successfully, but we describe other situations when this may not be the case. Applying Moran's I residual diagnostics to assess models for silver-haired (Lasionycteris noctivagans) and little brown (Myotis lucifugus) bats only provided evidence of residual spatial correlation among detections. Targeting specific model assumptions using carefully chosen residual diagnostics is valuable for any analysis, and we remove previous barriers for occupancy analyses-lack of examples and practical advice.},

Is the future of Earth to be fully domesticated, an engineered global garden managed by technocrats to serve humanity? The schism between advocates of rewilding and those who accept and even celebrate a ``post-wild'' world is arguably the hottest intellectual battle in contemporary conservation. In Keeping the Wild, a group of prominent scientists, writers, and conservation activists responds to the Anthropocene-boosters who claim that wild nature is no more (or in any case not much worth caring about), that human-caused extinction is acceptable, and that ``novel ecosystems'' are an adequate replacement for natural landscapes. With rhetorical fists swinging, the book's contributors argue that these ``new environmentalists'' embody the hubris of the managerial mindset and offer a conservation strategy that will fail to protect life in all its buzzing, blossoming diversity. With essays from Eileen Crist, David Ehrenfeld, Dave Foreman, Lisi Krall, Harvey Locke, Curt Meine, Kathleen Dean Moore, Michael Soul\'e, Terry Tempest Williams and other leading thinkers, Keeping the Wild provides an introduction to this important debate, a critique of the Anthropocene boosters' attack on traditional conservation, and unapologetic advocacy for wild nature.},

The method of parsimony analysis, which has been used to estimate substitution patterns in real sequences, has serious drawbacks and leads to results difficult to interpret. In this paper a model-based maximum likelihood approach is proposed for estimating substitution patterns in real sequences. Nucleotide substitution is assumed to follow a homogeneous Markov process, and the general reversible process model (REV) and the unrestricted model without the reversibility assumption are used. These models are also applied to examine the adequacy of the model of Hasegawa et al. (J. Mol. Evol. 1985;22:160-174) (HKY85). Two data sets are analyzed. For the psi eta-globin pseudogenes of six primate species, the REV models fits the data much better than HKY85, while, for a segment of mtDNA sequences from nine primates, REV cannot provide a significantly better fit than HKY85 when rate variation over sites is taken into account in the models. It is concluded that the use of the REV model in phylogenetic analysis can be recommended, especially for large data sets or for sequences with extreme substitution patterns, while HKY85 may be expected to provide a good approximation. The use of the unrestricted model does not appear to be worthwhile.},

In a notorious case, a coalition of two adult male lions from Tsavo, southern Kenya, cooperatively killed dozens of railway workers in 1898.

Yet the full extent of the lions' man-eating behavior is unknown; estimates range widely from 28 to 135 victims. Here we use stable isotope ratios to quantify increasing dietary specialization on novel prey during a time of food limitation. For one lion, the delta(13)C and delta(15)N values of bone collagen and hair keratin (which reflect dietary inputs over years and months, respectively) reveal isotopic changes that are consistent with a progressive dietary specialization on humans. These findings not only support the hypothesis that prey scarcity drives individual dietary specialization, but also demonstrate that sustained dietary individuality can exist within a cooperative framework. The intensity of human predation (up to 30\% reliance during the final months of 1898) is also associated with severe craniodental infirmities, which may have further promoted the inclusion of unconventional prey under perturbed environmental conditions.},

However, theoretical predictions of how rapid evolution can affect ecological dynamics are inconclusive and often depend on untested model assumptions. Here we report that rapid prey evolution in response to oscillating predator density affects predator-prey (rotifer-algal) cycles in laboratory microcosms. Our experiments tested explicit predictions from a model for our system that allows prey evolution. We verified the predicted existence of an evolutionary tradeoff between algal competitive ability and defence against consumption, and examined its effects on cycle dynamics by manipulating the evolutionary potential of the prey population. Single-clone algal cultures (lacking genetic variability) produced short cycle periods and typical quarter-period phase lags between prey and predator densities, whereas multi-clonal (genetically variable) algal cultures produced long cycles with prey and predator densities nearly out of phase, exactly as predicted. These results confirm that prey evolution can substantially alter predator-prey dynamics, and therefore that attempts to understand population oscillations in nature cannot neglect potential effects from ongoing rapid evolution.},

In particular, the sleeping chironomid Polypedilum vanderplanki is known for the remarkable ability of its larvae to withstand almost complete desiccation by entering a state called anhydrobiosis. Chromosome numbers in chironomids are higher than in other dipterans and this extra genomic resource might facilitate rapid adaptation to novel environments. We used improved sequencing strategies to assemble a chromosome-level genome sequence for P. vanderplanki for deep comparative analysis of genomic location of genes associated with desiccation tolerance. Using whole genome-based cross-species and intra-species analysis, we provide evidence for the unique functional specialization of Chromosome 4 through extensive acquisition of novel genes. In contrast to other insect genomes, in the sleeping chironomid a uniquely high degree of subfunctionalization in paralogous anhydrobiosis genes occurs in this chromosome, as well as pseudogenization in a highly duplicated gene family. Our findings suggest that the Chromosome 4 in Polypedilum is a site of high genetic turnover, allowing it to act as a `sandbox' for evolutionary experiments, thus facilitating the rapid adaptation of midges to harsh environments.},

Respiration exhibits an exponential temperature dependence at the subcellular and individual levels1, but at the ecosystem level respiration can be modified by many variables2\textendash 4 including community abundance and biomass5, which vary substantially among ecosystems6. Despite its importance for predicting the responses of the bio- sphere to climate change, it is as yet unknown whether the temper- ature dependence of ecosystem respiration varies systematically between aquatic and terrestrial environments. Here we use the largest database of respiratory measurements yet compiled to show that the sensitivity of ecosystem respiration to seasonal changes in temperature is remarkably similar for diverse environments encompassing lakes, rivers, estuaries, the open ocean and forested and non-forested terrestrial ecosystems, with an average activation energy similar to that of the respiratory complex3 (approximately 0.65 electronvolts (eV)). By contrast, annual ecosystem respiration shows a substantially greater temperature dependence across aquatic (approximately 0.65 eV) versus terrestrial ecosystems (approximately 0.32 eV) that span broad geographic gradients in temperature. Using a model5 derived from metabolic theory7, these findings can be reconciled by similarities in the biochemical kinetics of metabolism at the subcellular level, and fundamental differences in the import- ance of other variables besides temperature\textemdash such as primary pro- ductivity and allochthonous carbon inputs\textemdash on the structure of aquatic and terrestrial biota at the community level.},

Using the SIC method, models containing density-dependent processes were selected for 23 of the 31 cases examined, while models containing complex density-dependent processes were selected in 19 of these 23 density dependence cases. The density-dependent models identified by SIC had various linear or nonlinear forms, suggesting variable patterns of population regulation in nature. Population dynamics may combine density-dependent, inversely density-dependent, and density-independent processes, which may operate at different times and under different density ranges. These results suggest that our approach offers an advance for modeling complex population dynamics, discovering complex regulation processes, and estimating the distribution of extinction times in changing environments.},

The mechanisms driving stability may respond differently to phylogenetic distance. Related species may be synchronic (have similar demographic responses over time), affecting fluctuation-dependent mechanisms: the storage effect should destabilize coexistence, and relative nonlinearity should be stronger due to increased fluctuations in competition. We tested these hypotheses using invasion analysis based on a model parameterized for 19 plant species from a semiarid grassland. Although weakly, coexistence stability increased with phylogenetic distance. Stabilization through fluctuation-independent niche differentiation was stronger between distant relatives as a result of weaker competition. Synchronicity was higher between close relatives, having the expected negative effects on the storage effect's contribution to coexistence. Relative nonlinearity was strong at both ends of the phylogenetic relatedness gradient but not in the middle. This may be the result of different nonlinear responses between distant relatives and of stronger fluctuations in competition due to synchronicity between closer relatives. The effect of phylogenetic distance on coexistence was almost negligible when pairwise species were analyzed, in accordance with previous research. Phylogenetic distance became more important as more species interacted, however, suggesting that evolutionary relatedness may be influential in species-rich communities.},

Comparative data on wing-dimorphic insects provide the most definitive evidence to date that habitat persistence selects for reduced dispersal capability. The increased fecundity of flightless females documents that a fitness trade-off exists between flight capability and reproduction. However, only recently have studies of nutrient consumption and allocation provided unequivocal evidence that this fitness trade-off results from a trade-off of internal resources. Recent studies involving wing-dimorphic insects document that flight capability imposes reproductive penalties in males as well as females. Direct information on hormone titers and their regulation implicates juvenile hormone and ecdysone in the control of wing-morph determination. However, detailed information is available for only one species, and the physiological regulation of wing-morph production remains poorly understood. Establishing a link betweeen the ecological factors that influence dispersal and the proximate physiological mechanisms regulating dispersal ability in the same taxon remains as a key challenge for future research.},

Through a two years study, we found that ants have a significant anti-herbivory effect on the host tree, with no effects on fruit production. At the end of the growing season, leaf toughness for plants without ants increased significantly. This suggests that ants are reliable and effective bodyguards for plants at larger spatial scales.

A signi\TH cant increase in MDA levels and a change in GR and GPx activities in the Cd2ϩ-treated P. akamusi were observed. The MDA in 25.0 and 50.0 mmol/liter treatments was signi\TH cantly higher than that of the control dose after 72 h exposure. GPx activity was signi\TH cantly induced by Cd2ϩ exposure only in the 50.0-mmol/liter treatment with a 0.59-fold increase in the control. All doses of Cd2ϩ signi\TH cantly suppressed GR activity compared with the \TH ndings for the control dose, with an inhibited rate up to 0.55-fold in the 25.0 mmol/liter Cd2ϩ treatment. SOD and GST activities were not altered. The results indicate that Cd2ϩ can induce oxidative stress as indicated by the changes in lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status. For P. akamusi, an increase in the dose that the threshold needed for defense (namely, MDA level and GPx activity) activation was achieved. From this, organisms can be hypothesized to enable cells to avoid oxidant stress up to a certain extent where damage is again measurable (higher Cd2ϩ concentration).},

However, no sequence information is available regarding Hb genes in Propsilocerus akamusi (Tokunaga), thus the change in Hb mRNA gene expression caused by environmental pollutants remains unknown. In this study, we cloned two Hb gene fragments (PaHbV and PaHbVII) from P. akamusi, analyzed the expression patterns of the PaHbV and PaHbVII transcripts in different tissues using Real-Time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and also measured the Cd levels in different tissues exposed to a sublethal concentration. The results showed significantly increased Cd concentrations and tissue-specific Cd distribution patterns in all of the tissues tested, including the hemolymph, during all time courses. A model describing the roles of specific tissues in Cd uptake and accumulation dynamics was also determined. The Malpighian tubules, gut, and epidermis were the primary sites of Cd accumulation, whereas the hemolymph was the temporary target organ of Cd accumulation, with the Cd being transferred to other internal tissues via the hemolymph. The relative mRNA expression profiles of PaHbV and PaHbVII indicated that their expression levels differed across the different tissues, indicating a tissue-specific response. Our results suggested a reverse effect between Hb expression and Cd accumulation during long-term Cd exposure in comparison with previous studies. The expressions of Hb genes in P. akamusi could be developed as biomarkers for assessing the general health conditions of freshwater ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Gene duplication is considered a major driving force for evolution of genetic novelty, thereby facilitating functional divergence and organismal diversity, including the process of speciation. Animals, fungi and plants are major eukaryotic kingdoms and the divergences between them are some of the most significant evolutionary events. Although gene duplications in each lineage have been studied extensively in various contexts, the extent of gene duplication prior to the split of plants and animals/fungi is not clear. Here, we have studied gene duplications in early eukaryotes by phylogenetic relative dating. We have reconstructed gene families (with one or more orthogroups) with members from both animals/fungi and plants by using two different clustering strategies. Extensive phylogenetic analyses of the gene families show that, among nearly 2,600 orthogroups identified, at least 300 of them still retain duplication that occurred before the divergence of the three kingdoms. We further found evidence that such duplications were also detected in some highly divergent protists, suggesting that these duplication events occurred in the ancestors of most major extant eukaryotic groups. Our phylogenetic analyses show that numerous gene duplications happened at the early stage of eukaryotic evolution, probably before the separation of known major eukaryotic lineages. We discuss the implication of our results in the contexts of different models of eukaryotic phylogeny. One possible explanation for the large number of gene duplication events is one or more large-scale duplications, possibly whole genome or segmental duplication(s), which provides a genomic basis for the successful radiation of early eukaryotes.},

This phenomenon, called the priority effect, is ubiquitous in nature and determines local community structure, but we know surprisingly little about how it influences biodiversity across different spatial scales. Here, we use a seasonal metacommunity model to show that biodiversity patterns and the homogenizing effect of high dispersal depend on the specific mechanisms underlying priority effects. When priority effects are driven by a numeric advantage, diversity measurements are highly sensitive to initial conditions and high dispersal homogenizes communities. However, when local priority effects arise from phenological shifts that alter species interaction strength (trait-mediated priority effects), local, regional, and temporal diversity are higher and are surprisingly robust to variation in dispersal and initial conditions, given spatiotemporal variations in phenology. Our results highlight that accounting for the mechanisms underlying priority effects is fundamental to understanding the maintenance of regional biodiversity.},
