% Authors can upload PDFs or they can upload the source files in a variety of formats for peer review. Manuscript PDFs can show figures and tables in the run of text for the convenience of reviewers. If authors are not supplying their own PDF, Editorial Manager will combine figure and text files into a single PDF (figures and tables will appear at the end of the PDF). Either way, embedded or at the end, the figure legend should, whenever possible, be placed on the same page as the figure to help reviewers.

\caption{Demonstration of how investment by one species affects other species in the community. (A) We start with a two-species community where the abundance and investments of species A are constant and not affected by species B, while those of species B are affected by species A and change though time as specified by the model. There is only one suite of traits. (B) If we perturb the system by instantly increasing the investment by species A, the effects this has on species B depend on the type of traits they can invest in. (C) For partitioning traits ($d = 1$), investment by A weakens the interspecific competition experienced by species B and causes a rapid initial increase in the abundance of B. Because reduced competition makes investment less necessary, species B also has a slower evolutionary decrease in investment. The reduced costs of investing cause the slow increase in abundance by species B after the initial response. (D) For conflicting traits ($d = -1$), investment by A strengthens the interspecific competition experienced by species B and causes a rapid initial decrease in the abundance of B. Species B then evolves greater investment to reduce the effects of competition from A, which allows species B to increase in abundance after the initial decrease. (C–D) Before the perturbation to species A, this community was simulated for 10,000 generations to allow species B to reach an equilibrium.}

\caption{Costs of investing (background color) and unique investment states for surviving species in two-species communities (points and dotted line) for investment costs being sub-additive ($\eta < 0$), additive ($\eta = 0$), or super-additive ($\eta > 0$). The line in the additive case shows the location of the neutrally stable ring. Both suites of traits are nearly neutral ($d_x = -10^{-6}$; $d_p = 10^{-6}$) to isolate the effects of investment cost to the investing species only. Background color indicates the proportional reduction from the maximum fitness without competition 
($\left[ \text{exp} (r_0) - \text{exp} (r_0 - f ( x_i^2 + 2 \eta x_i p_i + 
p_i^2 )) \right] / \text{exp}(r_0)$),
so darker colors indicate a greater cost of investment. 
Arrows show the direction and strength of selection
($ F_i^{-1} \partial F_i / \partial x_i $ and 
$ F_i^{-1} \partial F_i / \partial p_i $)
if a species at the nearest equilibrium point is perturbed to the arrow’s
starting location.}

\caption{Examples of how non-adaptive stochasticity affects investment evolution, for investment costs being (A) weakly sub-additive ($\eta = -0.01$) and (B) weakly super-additive ($\eta = 0.01$). Each sub-panel shows the trajectories (lines) in investment space for 4 species started under each scenario. Open points indicate starting investments. Closed, black points indicate ending investments. Gray shaded curves inside each plot show the probability density for the normal distributions used to generate stochasticity in conflicting (bottom curve) or partitioning (left curve) investment evolution. No curve indicates no stochasticity.}

\caption{Effects of a community with strong partitioning investment on subsequent species evolution. Shown are simulations of 3-species communities where the species are added 100 generations apart. Costs are super-additive, and two simulations were run: (A--C) all three species invest in partitioning traits and (D--F) two invest in partitioning and one in conflicting traits. The left-most panels (A,D) show starting species investments (open points) and where they evolve to at equilibrium (closed points); numbers inside points indicate the order species were added. All points here lie on one axis; some points were shifted to avoid overlapping. The upper sub-panels in the right column (B,E) show how both conflicting (closed points, solid lines) and partitioning (open points, dashed lines) investments change through time. The lower sub-panels in the right column (C,F) show how abundances change through time. For all panels in the right column, points show conditions when the species first invades the community. In all plots, colors indicate species and are consistent within rows.}

Shown are simulations of 6-species communities where investment costs are super-additive and where four species invest in partitioning traits and two in conflicting traits. Two simulations were run: (A--C) one where species were added 100 generations apart, and (D--F) another where species were added 1,000 generations apart. The left-most panels (A,D) show starting species investments (open points) and where they evolve to at equilibrium (closed points). Numbers inside points indicate the order species were added, and species with no equilibrium points went extinct. All points here lie on one axis; some points were shifted to avoid overlapping. The upper sub-panels in the right column (B,E) show how both conflicting (closed points, solid lines) and partitioning (open points, dashed lines) investments change through time.
