% For both 2 and 3 traits:
%
% Coexistence occurs when $d \ge 0$ (i.e., when non-conflicting or neutral)
%
% I need to check on what happens when you have both conflicting and non-conflicting
% traits.
% I think the analytical solutions related to coexistence / stability will
% help with this.

% \subsection*{Patterns of outcomes}
%
% For 2 traits...
%
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item when $\eta < 0$ (sub-additive), one state where both traits are equal
%     \item when $\eta = 0$, neutrally stable ring
%     \item when $\eta > 0$ (super-additive), 2 alternative stable states, one for each trait being
%         maximized and the other being 0
% \end{enumerate}
%
% % unstable state when all traits are zero
% %
% % saddle node when $\eta \ne 0$:
% % when starting value is exactly on line perpendicular to
% % the line formed by the alternative stable states, it'll go to the
% % two unstable states that are of the opposite scenario.
% % By scenario I mean that when stable states are at $V_1 = V_2$,
% % points on the saddle node go to the two points where $V_1 = -V_2$.
% % The inverse is also true.
%
%
% For 3 traits...
%
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item when $\eta < 0$ (sub-additive), one state where all traits are equal
%     \item when $\eta = 0$, neutrally stable "shell"
%     \item when $\eta > 0$ (sper-additive), 3 alternative stable states,
%         one for each trait being maximized and the other being 0
% \end{enumerate}
%
% When you have two traits that are sub-additive and two that are super-additive, you
% can get neutral partial-rings, but this is dependent on all $\eta$ being equal.
% So I don't actually think this is all that interesting.
%
% % I haven't explored this in detail, except that there is also
% % an unstable state when all traits are zero.
