% Alternative community states can be described by both the number of species present and by the
% ecologically relevant traits that those species possess. How communities arrive at these states
% is a longstanding question in community ecology
% \citep{Drake:1991bv,Weiher:1999tf,Gleason:1927cj,Clements:1936hw}.
% How community processes shape trait evolution and species filtering is an equally enduring
% question in evolutionary ecology
% \citep{Darwin:1859to,Loeuille:2018cx,Pontarp:2018hv,MacArthur:1964uv,Schluter:2000jz,Muschick:2012ha}.
% Despite the length of time spent on these topics, few generalizations exist \citep{Lawton:1999fj}, at
% least partly because of context-dependent mechanisms \citep{Drake:1991bv} and the complex effects of
% history \citep{Drake:1991bv,Chase:2003ko,Weiher:1999tf}.
%
% Competition has been a particularly well-studied process for shaping communities and trait evolution
% \citep{Simpson:1953wr,Volterra:1928fy,Macarthur:1964kv,Hardin:1960ep,Roughgarden:1976eh,Rosenzweig:1978bj,
% Armstrong:1980id,Hutchinson:1959tq,BrownJr:1956wi,Day:2004db}.
% In many theoretical models, competition strength between two species is inversely proportional to
% the difference in their ecologically relevant trait values
% (\citealp{Abrams:1983jz,Macarthur:1967jf,Volterra:1928fy,Macarthur:1964kv,Rosenzweig:1978bj};
% reviewed in \citealp{Taper:1992kz,Taper:1985ub,Abrams:1986tx,Dayan:2005ub}).
% Models can include this relationship either explicitly \citep[e.g.,][]{Burger:2006tq,Roughgarden:1976eh,Zu:2008uw}
% or implicitly, where trait values represent the ability to extract different resources
% \citep[e.g.,][]{Macarthur:1964kv,Ackermann:2004bb}. In either case, this process can generate or maintain
% trait diversity in a range of forms, including alternative stable states and limit cycles
% \citep{Gilpin:1975gz,Burger:2006tq}.
% In other models, traits change how species perform in competitive contests.
% This can often lead to arms races, where traits cycle or continually increase
% \citep{MaynardSmith:1986tw,Parker:1983io}.
% When \citet{Abrams:1994th} explicitly included population dynamics into a similar model, more complex
% patterns emerged, such as dimorphism and alternative stable states.
%
% Here, we use a model of evolution in traits affecting competition to describe in detail
% (1) the conditions under which multiple species can coexist and
% (2) the patterns in trait values for surviving species.
% To improve mathematical tractability, we treat the relationship between traits and competition’s
% effects as an abstraction, where traits directly affect competitors’ per-capita growth rates.
% We also do not force a particular fitness landscape on the system. Rather, our model includes
% only costs, benefits, and non-additive effects of each trait. Costs and non-additive effects
% directly affect the growth rate of the focal species. Benefits reduce the effects of intraspecific
% competition and can either increase or decrease competition experienced by other species, depending
% on whether evolution is conflicting or non-conflicting.
