\section*{Abstract}


% Recent studies have shown the usefulness of incorporating trait evolution into models
% of competition in the context of community assembly.
% In these and other models, competition is often treated implicitly, as a side-effect of,
% for example, interactions with external resources.
% Here, we used a simple community model where members' evolving traits directly affect
% competition experienced by all members of the community.
% We evaluated how evolving competition affects outcomes of community assembly,
% including the conditions under which coexistence occurs and the equilibria at
% which communities ultimately arrive.
% Treating competition as an abstraction also allowed us to examine complex
% patterns relating to community equilibria.
% We find that coexistence occurs only when evolution is non-conflicting or neutral
% and that community "saturation" affects the shape of fitness landscapes.
% Trait non-additive effects influence whether more than one evolutionarily
% stable community exists, and complex patterns such as alternative stable
% states and neutrally stable attractor manifolds are possible.
